<h5><a name="intro_intro" id="intro_intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, in accordance with act of Congress, was continued during the
fiscal year 1885&ndash;’86.</p>

<p>The general plan upon which the work has been prosecuted in former
years, and which has been explained in earlier reports, was continued in
operation.</p>

<p>General lines of investigation were indicated by the Director, and
the details intrusted to selected persons trained in their several
pursuits, the results of whose labors are published from time to time in
the manner provided for by law. A&nbsp;brief statement of the work upon
which each of these special students was engaged during the year, with
its condensed result, is presented below. This, however, does not
specify in detail all of the studies undertaken or services rendered by
them, as particular lines of research have been temporarily suspended in
order to accomplish immediately objects regarded as of superior
importance. From this cause the publication of several treatises and
monographs has been delayed, although in some instances they have been
heretofore reported as substantially completed, and, indeed, as partly
in type.</p>

<p>The present opportunity is used to invite and urge again the
assistance of explorers, writers, and students, who are not and
<span class="pagenum">XVI</span>
<a name="pageXVI" id="pageXVI"> </a>
may not desire to be officially connected with this Bureau. Their
contributions, whether in the shape of suggestion or of extended
communications, will be gratefully acknowledged and carefully
considered. If published in whole or in part, either in the series of
reports or in monographs or bulletins, as the liberality of Congress may
in future allow, the contributors will always receive proper credit.</p>

<p>The items which form the subject of the present report are presented
in two principal divisions. The first relates to the work prosecuted in
the field, and the second to the office work, which consists largely of
the preparation for publication of the results of the field work,
complemented and extended by study of the literature of the several
subjects and by correspondence relating to them.</p>


<h5 class="section"><a name="intro_field" id="intro_field">
FIELD WORK.</a></h5>

<p>This heading may be divided into, first, Mound Explorations; second,
Explorations in Stone Villages; and, third, General Field Studies, among
which those upon mythology, linguistics, and customs have been during
the year the most prominent.</p>

MOUND EXPLORATIONS.</a></h6>

WORK OF PROF. CYRUS THOMAS.</a></h6>

<p>The work of the mound-exploring division, under the charge of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, was carried on during the fiscal year with the same
success that had attended its earlier operations.</p>

<p>It is proper to explain that the title given above to the division
does not fully indicate the extent of its work. The simple exploration
of mounds is but a part of its scope, which embraces, as contemplated in
its organization, a&nbsp;careful examination and study of the
archeologic remains in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.
The limitation of the force engaged on this work renders it necessary
that the investigations should be conducted along but one or two
selected lines at a time.</p>

<p>Before and even during some portion of the year now
<span class="pagenum">XVII</span>
<a name="pageXVII" id="pageXVII"> </a>
reported upon attention had been devoted almost exclusively to the
exploration of individual mounds, with a view of ascertaining the
different types of tumuli, as regards form, construction, and other
particulars and the vestiges of art and human remains found in them. The
study of these works in their relation to each other and their
segregation into groups, and of the mural works, inclosures, and works
of defense, is important in the attempt to obtain indications of the
social life and customs of the builders. This plan of study had not
received the attention desirable and involved the necessity of careful
surveys. It was thought best to make a commencement this year in this
branch of investigation.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1885 Prof. Thomas was in Wisconsin, engaged in
investigating and studying the effigy mounds and other ancient works of
that section.</p>

<p>Messrs. James D. Middleton, John P. Rogan, and John W. Emmert were
permanent assistants during the year; Mr. Charles M. Smith, Rev.
S.&nbsp;D. Peet, and Mr. H.&nbsp;L. Reynolds were employed for short
periods as temporary assistants.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of 1885 Messrs. Middleton and Emmert
were at work on the mounds and ancient monuments of southwestern
Wisconsin, the former surveying the groups of effigy mounds and the
latter exploring the conical tumuli. When the weather became too cold
for operations in that section they were transferred to east Tennessee,
where Mr. Emmert continued at work throughout the remainder of the
fiscal year.</p>

<p>When it had been decided to commence the preparation of a report on
the field work of the division, in the hope of its early publication,
Mr. Middleton was called to the office to assist in that preparation,
where he remained, preparing maps and plats and making a catalogue of
the collections, until the latter part of April, 1886, when he again
entered upon field work in the southern part of Illinois, among the
graves of that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogan was in charge of the office work from the 1st of July until
the latter part of August, during which time Prof. Thomas was in the
field, as before mentioned. He was engaged
<span class="pagenum">XVIII</span>
<a name="pageXVIII" id="pageXVIII"> </a>
during the remainder of the year in exploring the mounds of northern
Georgia and east Tennessee.</p>

<p>Rev. S. D. Peet was employed for a few months in preparing a
preliminary map showing the localities of the antiquarian remains of
Wisconsin and the areas formerly occupied by the several Indian tribes
which are known to have inhabited that region. In addition he prepared
for use in the report notes on the distribution and character of the
mounds and other ancient works of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was engaged during the month of June, 1886, in exploring
mounds and investigating the ancient works in southwestern Pennsylvania;
and Mr. Reynolds, during the same time, in tracing and exploring the
monumental remains of western New York.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the details necessary for office work in the
preparation of maps and plats for the report, and cataloguing the
collection, the amount of field work accomplished was equal to that done
in previous years. Although, as before stated, one of the assistants,
Mr. Middleton, was chiefly engaged, while in the field, in surveying,
about 3,500 specimens were collected and a large number of drawings
obtained illustrating the different modes of construction of the
mounds.</p>

EXPLORATIONS IN STONE VILLAGES.</a></h6>

WORK OF DIRECTOR J. W. POWELL.</a></h6>

<p>During the summer of 1885 the Director, accompanied by Mr. James
Stevenson, revisited portions of Arizona and New Mexico in which many
structures are found which have greatly interested travelers and
anthropologists, and about which various theories have grown. The
results of the investigation have been so much more distinct and
comprehensive than any before obtained that they require to be reported
with some detail.</p>

<p>On the plain to the west of the Little Colorado River and north of
the San Francisco Mountain there are many scattered ruins, usually
having one, two, or three rooms each, all of which are built of basaltic
cinders and blocks. Through the plain a valley runs to the north, and
then east to the Little Colorado.
<span class="pagenum">XIX</span>
<a name="pageXIX" id="pageXIX"> </a>
Down the midst of the valley there is a wash, through which, in seasons
of great rainfall, a&nbsp;stream courses. Along this stream there are
extensive ruins built of sandstone and limestone. At one place a village
site was discovered, in which several hundred people once found shelter.
To the north of this and about twenty-five miles from the summit of San
Francisco Peak there is a volcanic cone of cinder and basalt. This small
cone had been used as the site of a village, a&nbsp;pueblo having been
built around the crater. The materials of construction were derived from
a great sandstone quarry near by, and the pit from which they were taken
was many feet in depth and extended over two or three acres of ground.
The cone rises on the west in a precipitous cliff from the valley of an
intermittent creek. The pueblo was built on that side at the summit of
the cliff, and extending on the north and south sides along the summit
of steep slopes, was inclosed on the east, so that the plaza was entered
by a covered way. The court, or plaza, was about one-third of an acre in
area. The little pueblo contained perhaps sixty or seventy rooms.
Southward of San Francisco Mountain many other ruins were found.</p>

<p>East of the San Francisco Peak, at a distance of about twelve miles,
another cinder cone was found. Here the cinders are soft and friable,
and the cone is a prettily shaped dome. On the southern slope there are
excavations into the indurated and coherent cinder mass, constituting
chambers, often ten or twelve feet in diameter and six to ten feet in
height. The chambers are of irregular shape, and occasionally a larger
central chamber forms a kind of vestibule to several smaller ones
gathered about it. The smaller chambers are sometimes at the same
altitude as the central or principal one, and sometimes at a lower
altitude. About one hundred and fifty of these chambers have been
excavated. Most of them are now partly filled by the caving in of the
walls and ceilings, but some of them are yet in a good state of
preservation. In these chambers, and about them on the summit and sides
of the cinder cone, many stone implements were found, especially
metates. Some bone implements also were discovered. At the very summit
of the little cone there is a plaza, inclosed by a rude wall made
<span class="pagenum">XX</span>
<a name="pageXX" id="pageXX"> </a>
of volcanic cinders, the floor of which was carefully leveled. The plaza
is about forty-five by seventy-five feet in area. Here the people lived
in underground houses&mdash;chambers hewn from the friable volcanic
cinders. Before them, to the south, west, and north, stretched beautiful
valleys, beyond which volcanic cones are seen rising amid pine forests.
The people probably cultivated patches of ground in the low valleys.</p>

<p>About eighteen miles still farther to the east of San Francisco
Mountain another ruined village was discovered, built about the crater
of a volcanic cone. This volcanic peak is of much greater magnitude. The
crater opens to the eastward. On the south many stone dwellings have
been built of the basaltic and cinder-like rocks. Between the ridge on
the south and another on the northwest there is a low saddle in which
other buildings have been erected, and in which a great plaza was found,
much like the one previously described. But the most interesting part of
this village was on the cliff which rose on the northwest side of the
crater. In this cliff are many natural caves, and the caves themselves
were utilized as dwellings by inclosing them in front with walls made of
volcanic rocks and cinders. These cliff dwellings are placed tier above
tier, in a very irregular way. In many cases natural caves were thus
utilized; in other cases cavate chambers were made; that is, chambers
have been excavated in the friable cinders. On the very summit of the
ridge stone buildings were erected, so that this village was in part a
cliff village, in part cavate, and in part the ordinary stone pueblo.
The valley below, especially to the southward, was probably occupied by
their gardens. In the chambers among the overhanging cliffs a great many
interesting relics were found, of stone, bone, and wood, and many
potsherds.</p>

<p>About eight miles southeast of Flagstaff, a&nbsp;little town on the
southern slope of San Francisco Mountain, Oak Creek enters a canyon,
which runs to the eastward and then southward for a distance of about
ten miles. The gorge is a precipitous box canyon for the greater part of
this distance. It is cut through carboniferous rocks&mdash;sandstones
and limestones&mdash;which are here nearly horizontal. The softer
sandstones rapidly disintegrate,
<span class="pagenum">XXI</span>
<a name="pageXXI" id="pageXXI"> </a>
and the harder sandstones and limestones remain. Thus broad shelves are
formed on the sides of the cliffs, and these shelves, or the deep
recesses between them, were utilized, so that here is a village of cliff
dwellings. There are several hundred rooms altogether. The rooms are of
sandstone, pretty carefully worked and laid in mortar, and the interior
of the rooms was plastered. The opening for the chimney was usually by
the side of the entrance, and the ceilings of the rooms are still
blackened with soot and smoke. Around this village, on the terrace of
the canyon, great numbers of potsherds, stone implements, and implements
of bone, horn, and wood were found; and here, as in all of the other
ruins mentioned, corncobs in great abundance were discovered.</p>

<p>In addition to the four principal ruins thus described many others
are found, most of them being of the ordinary pueblo type. From the
evidence presented it would seem that they had all been occupied at a
comparatively late date. They were certainly not abandoned more than
three or four centuries ago.</p>

<p>Later in the season the Director visited the Supai Indians of
Cataract Canyon, and was informed by them that their present home had
been taken up not many generations ago, and that their ancestors
occupied the ruins which have been described; and they gave such a
circumstantial account of the occupation and of their expulsion by the
Spaniards, that no doubt can be entertained of the truth of their
traditions in this respect. The Indians of Cataract Canyon doubtless
lived on the north, east, and south of San Francisco Mountain at the
time this country was discovered by the Spaniards, and they subsequently
left their cliff and cavate dwellings and moved into Cataract Canyon,
where they now live. It is thus seen that these cliff and cavate
dwellings are not of an ancient prehistoric time, but that they were
occupied by a people still existing, who also built pueblos of the
common type.</p>

<p>Later in the season the party visited the cavate ruins near Santa
Clara, previously explored by Mr. Stevenson. Here, on the western side
of the Rio Grande del Norte, was found a system of volcanic peaks,
constituting what is known as the
<span class="pagenum">XXII</span>
<a name="pageXXII" id="pageXXII"> </a>
Valley Range. To the east of these peaks, stretching far beyond the
present channel of the Rio Grande, there was once a great Tertiary lake,
which was gradually filled with the sands washed into it on every hand
and by the ashes blown out of the adjacent volcanoes. This great lake
formation is in some places a thousand feet in thickness. When the lake
was filled the Rio Grande cut its channel through the midst to a depth
of many hundreds of feet. The volcanic mountains to the westward send to
the Rio Grande a number of minor streams, which in a general way are
parallel with one another. The Rio Grande itself, and all of these
lateral streams, have cut deep gorges and canyons, so that there are
long, irregular table-lands, or mesas, extending from the Rio Grande
back to the Valley Mountains, each mesa being severed from the adjacent
one by a canyon or canyon valley; and each of these long mesas rises
with a precipitous cliff from the valley below. The cliffs themselves
are built of volcanic sands and ashes, and many of the strata are
exceedingly light and friable. The specific gravity of some of these
rocks is so low that they will float on water. Into the faces of these
cliffs, in the friable and easily worked rock, many chambers have been
excavated; for mile after mile the cliffs are studded with them, so that
altogether there are many thousands. Sometimes a chamber or series of
chambers is entered from a terrace, but usually they were excavated many
feet above any landing or terrace below, so that they could be reached
only by ladders. In other places artificial terraces were built by
constructing retaining walls and filling the interior next to the cliff
with loose rock and sand. Very often steps were cut into the face of a
cliff and a rude stairway formed by which chambers could be reached. The
chambers were very irregularly arranged and very irregular in size and
structure. In many cases there is a central chamber, which seems to have
been a general living room for the people, back of which two, three, or
more chambers somewhat smaller are found. The chambers occupied by one
family are sometimes connected with those occupied by another family, so
that two or three or four sets of chambers have interior communication.
Usually, however, the communication from one system of
<span class="pagenum">XXIII</span>
<a name="pageXXIII" id="pageXXIII"> </a>
chambers to another was by the outside. Many of the chambers had
evidently been occupied as dwellings. They still contained fireplaces
and evidences of fire; there were little caverns or shelves in which
various vessels were placed, and many evidences of the handicraft of the
people were left in stone, bone, horn, and wood, and in the chambers and
about the sides of the cliffs potsherds are abundant. On more careful
survey it was found that many chambers had been used as stables for
asses, goats, and sheep. Sometimes they had been filled a few inches, or
even two or three feet, with the excrement of these animals. Ears of
corn and corncobs were also found in many places. Some of the chambers
were evidently constructed to be used as storehouses or caches for
grain. Altogether it is very evident that the cliff houses have been
used in comparatively modern times; at any rate since the people owned
asses, goats, and sheep. The rock is of such a friable nature that it
will not stand atmospheric degradation very long, and there is abundant
evidence of this character testifying to the recent occupancy of these
cavate dwellings.</p>

<p>Above the cliffs, on the mesas, which have already been described,
evidences of more ancient ruins were found. These were pueblos built of
cut stone rudely dressed. Every mesa had at least one ancient pueblo
upon it, evidently far more ancient than the cavate dwellings found in
the face of the cliffs. It is, then, very plain that the cavate
dwellings are not of great age; that they have been occupied since the
advent of the white man, and that on the summit of the cliffs there are
ruins of more ancient pueblos.</p>

<p>Now, the pottery of Santa Clara had been previously studied by Mr.
Stevenson, who made a large collection there two or three years ago, and
it was at once noticed that the potsherds of these cliff dwellings are,
both in shape and material, like those now made by the Santa Clara
Indians. The peculiar pottery of Santa Clara is readily distinguished,
as may be seen by examining the collection now in the National Museum.
While encamped in the valley below, the party met a Santa Clara Indian
and engaged him in conversation. From him the history of the cliff
dwellings was soon obtained. His statement was that originally his
people lived in six pueblos, built of cut stone,
<span class="pagenum">XXIV</span>
<a name="pageXXIV" id="pageXXIV"> </a>
upon the summit of the mesas; that there came a time when they were at
war with the Apaches and Navajos, when they abandoned their stone
pueblos above and for greater protection excavated the chambers in the
cliffs below; that when this war ended part of them returned to the
pueblos above, which were rebuilt; that there afterward came another
war, with the Comanche Indians, and they once more resorted to cliff
dwellings. At the close of this war they built a pueblo in the valley of
the Rio Grande, but at the time of the invasion of the Spaniards their
people refused to be baptized, and a Spanish army was sent against them,
when they abandoned the valley below and once more inhabited the cliff
dwellings above. Here they lived many years, until at last a wise and
good priest brought them peace, and persuaded them to build the pueblo
which they now occupy&mdash;the village of Santa Clara. The ruin of the
pueblo which they occupied previous to the invasion of the Spaniards is
still to be seen about a mile distant from the present pueblo.</p>

<p>The history thus briefly given was repeated by the governor and by
other persons, all substantially to the same effect. It is therefore
evident that the cavate dwellings of the Santa Clara region belong to a
people still extant; that they are not of great antiquity, and do not
give evidence of a prehistoric and now extinct race.</p>

<p>Plans and measurements were made of some of the villages with
sufficient accuracy to prepare models. Photographic views and sketches
were also procured with which to illustrate a detailed report of the
subject to be published by the Bureau.</p>

WORK OF MR. JAMES STEVENSON.</a></h6>

<p>After the investigations made in company with the Director, as
mentioned above, Mr. Stevenson proceeded with a party to the ancient
province of Tusayan, in Arizona, to study the characteristics of the
Moki tribes, its inhabitants, and to make collections of such implements
and utensils as illustrate their arts and industries. Several months
were spent among the villages, resulting in a large collection of rare
objects, all of which were selected with special reference to their
anthropologic

importance. This collection contains many articles novel in character
and with uses differing from any heretofore obtained, and forms an
important addition to the collections in the National Museum.</p>

<p>A study of their religious ceremonials and mythology was made, of
which full notes were taken. Sketches were made of their masks and other
objects which could not be obtained for the collection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevenson was also enabled to obtain a minute description of the
celebrated dance, or medicine ceremony, of the Navajos, called the
Yéibit-cai. She made complete sketches of the sand altars, masks, and
other objects employed in this ceremonial.</p>

WORK OF MESSRS. VICTOR MINDELEFF AND COSMOS MINDELEFF.</a></h6>

<p>Mr. Victor Mindeleff, who had been engaged for several years in
investigating the architecture of the pueblos and the ruins of the
southwest, was at the beginning of the fiscal year at work among the
Moki towns in Arizona, in charge of a party. Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff left
Washington on July 6 for the same locality. He was placed in charge of
the surveying necessary in the Stone Village region, and the result of
his work is included in the general report of that division.</p>

<p>Visits were paid to the Moki villages in succession, obtaining
drawings of some constructional details, and also traditions bearing on
the ruins in that vicinity. The main camp was established near
Mashongnavi, one of the Moki villages. A&nbsp;large ruined pueblo,
formerly occupied by the Mashongnavi, was here surveyed. No standing
walls are found at the present time, and many portions of the plan are
entirely obliterated. Typical fragments of pottery were collected.</p>

<p>Following this work, four other ruined pueblos were surveyed, and
such portions of them as clearly indicated dividing walls were drawn on
the ground plans.</p>

<p>Many of the ruins in this vicinity, according to the traditions of
the Mokis, have been occupied in comparatively recent times&mdash;-a
number of them having been abandoned since the Spanish conquest of the
country. In several cases the villages
<span class="pagenum">XXVI</span>
<a name="pageXXVI" id="pageXXVI"> </a>
now occupied are not upon the same sites as those first visited by the
Spaniards, although retaining the same names.</p>

<p>While the work of surveying was in progress, in charge of Mr. Cosmos
Mindeleff, Mr. Victor Mindeleff made a visit of several days at Keam
Canyon, there to meet a number of the Navajo Indians to explain the
purpose of the work and allay the suspicions of these Indians,
a&nbsp;necessary precaution, as some of the proposed work was laid out
in Canyon de Chelly, in the heart of their reservation. Recent
restrictions to which they had been subjected, as a consequence of new
surveys of the reservation line, had made them especially distrustful of
parties equipped with instruments for surveying. Incidental to
explanations of the purpose of the work, an opportunity was afforded of
obtaining a number of mythologic notes, and also interesting data
regarding the construction of their “hogans,” with the rules prescribing
the arrangement of each part of the frame and other particulars.
A&nbsp;number of ceremonial songs are sung at the building of these
houses, but of these only one could be secured, which was obtained in
the original and translated. Whenever opportunity occurred, during the
progress of the work, photographs and diagrams of construction of
“hogans” were procured.</p>

<p>On August 17 the ceremony of the snake-dance took place at
Mashongnavi, similar in every detail to that performed at Walpi, and
differing only in the number of participants. Several instantaneous
negatives of the various phases of the dance were secured. On the
following day the same ceremony was performed on a larger scale at
Walpi, the easternmost of the Moki villages.</p>

<p>Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff assisted in collecting from the present
inhabitants of the region legendary information bearing upon ruins and
in observing the snake-dances, a&nbsp;description of which was prepared
for publication.</p>

<p>While the surveys of the ruins were in progress many detailed studies
were made of special features in the modern villages, particularly among
the “kivas” or religious chambers. In several instances the large
roofing timbers of the “kiva” were found to be the old beams from the
Spanish churches,
<span class="pagenum">XXVII</span>
<a name="pageXXVII" id="pageXXVII"> </a>
hewn square, and decorated with the characteristic rude carving of the
old Spanish work. A&nbsp;number of legends connected with the ruined
pueblos were recorded.</p>

<p>On closing this work in the vicinity of the Moki villages, late in
August, the party moved into Keam Canyon, en route for Canyon de Chelly.
A&nbsp;day was devoted to the survey of a small pueblo of irregular
elliptical outline, situated about eighteen miles northeast from Keam
Canyon. This ruin is in excellent state of preservation and exhibits in
the masonry some stones of remarkably large size. The early part of
September was employed in making a close survey of the Mummy Cave group
of ruins in Canyon de la Muerte, this work including a five-foot contour
map of the ground and the rocky ledge over which the houses were
distributed. Detailed drawings of a number of special features were made
here, particularly in connection with the circular ceremonial chambers.
The latter were so buried under the accumulated debris of fallen walls
that much excavation was required to lay bare the details of internal
arrangement. A&nbsp;high class of workmanship is here exhibited, both in
the execution of the constructional features and in the interior
decoration of these chambers. Later the White House group, in the Canyon
de Chelly, comprising a village and cliff houses, was examined and
platted in the same manner.</p>

<p>The drawings and plans were supplemented with a series of
photographs. Some negatives of Navajo houses were also made.</p>

<p>On closing this work the party went into Fort Defiance, en route for
Zuñi, and thence to Ojo Caliente, a&nbsp;modern farming pueblo of the
Zuñi, about twelve miles south of the principal village. Here two ruins
of villages, thought to belong to the ancient Cibola group, were
platted. One of these villages had been provided with a circular
reservoir of large size, partially walled in with masonry. Here, also,
the well preserved walls of a stone church can be seen. The other
contains the remains of a large church, built of adobe. A&nbsp;series of
widely scattered house-clusters, occurring two miles west of Ojo
Caliente, was also examined, but the earth had drifted over the fallen
walls
<span class="pagenum">XXVIII</span>
<a name="pageXXVIII" id="pageXXVIII"> </a>
and so covered them that the arrangement of rooms could scarcely be
traced at all.</p>

<p>The modern village of Ojo Caliente was also surveyed and diagrams and
photographs made.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September camp was moved to the vicinity of Zuñi.
Here four other villages of the Cibola group and the old villages on the
mesa of Ta-ai-ya-lo-ne were examined. Camp was then moved to Nutria,
a&nbsp;farming pueblo of Zuñi. From this camp Nutria was surveyed and
photographed, and also the village of Pescado, which is occupied only
during the farming season. Both of these modern farming pueblos appear
to be built on the ruins of more ancient villages, the remains of which
were especially noticeable in the case of Pescado, where the very
carefully executed masonry, characteristic of the ancient methods of
construction, could be seen outcropping at many points.</p>

WORK OF MR. E. W. NELSON.</a></h6>

<p>Following the return of the main party to Washington, some
preliminary exploration was carried on by Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson, who
made an examination of the headwaters of the South Fork of Salt River,
but did not find any ruins. Thence the Blue Ridge was crossed, and the
valley of the Blue Fork of the San Francisco River visited. Here ruins
were frequently increasing in number toward the south. Farther south
three sets of cliff ruins were also located.</p>

GENERAL FIELD STUDIES.</a></h6>

<h6><a name="intro_field_general_yarrow" id="intro_field_general_yarrow">
WORK OF DR. H. C. YARROW.</a></h6>

<p>During the summer and fall of 1885, Dr. H.&nbsp;C. Yarrow, acting
assistant surgeon U.S. Army, examined points in Arizona and Utah. In the
vicinity of Springerville, Apache County, Arizona, in company with Mr.
E.&nbsp;W. Nelson, he visited a number of ancient pueblos and discovered
that the people formerly occupying the towns had followed the custom of
burying their dead immediately outside the walls of their habitations,
marking the places of sepulcher with circles of stones.
<span class="pagenum">XXIX</span>
<a name="pageXXIX" id="pageXXIX"> </a>
The graves were four or five feet in depth, and various household
utensils had been deposited with the dead. Mr. Nelson, who had made a
careful search for these cemeteries, informed him of the locality of
hundreds. Unfortunately for anthropometric science, most of the bones
are too much decayed to be of practical value. The places of burial
selected at these pueblos are similar to the burial places discovered in
1874 near the large ruined pueblo of Abiquiu, in the valley of the
Chama, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Yarrow also visited the Moki pueblos in Arizona, and obtained
from one of the principal men a clear and succinct account of their
burial customs. While there he witnessed the famous snake dance, which
occurs every two years, and is supposed to have the effect of producing
rain. From his knowledge of the reptilian fauna of the country he was
able to identify the species of serpents used in the dance, and from
personal examination satisfied himself that the fangs had not been
extracted from the poisonous varieties. He thinks, however, that the
reptiles are somewhat tamed by handling during the four days that they
are kept in the estufas and possibly are made to eject the greater part
of the venom contained in the sacs at the roots of the teeth, by being
teased and forced to strike at different objects held near them. He does
not think that a vegetable decoction in which they are washed has a
stupefying effect, as has been supposed by some. He also obtained from a
Moki high priest a full account of the ceremonies attending the dance.
Through the assistance of Mr. Thomas V. Keam, of Keam Canyon, Arizona,
and Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen, he was able to procure from a noted Navajo
wise man an exact account of the burial customs of his people, as well
as valuable information regarding their medical practices, especially
such as relate to obstetrics.</p>

<p>From Arizona Dr. Yarrow proceeded to Utah, and made an examination of
an old rock cemetery near Farmington, finding it similar to the one he
discovered in 1872 near the town of Fillmore. The bodies had been
carried far up the side of the mountain; cavities had been prepared in a
rock slide, and the bodies placed therein. Branches of cottonwood were
then laid
<span class="pagenum">XXX</span>
<a name="pageXXX" id="pageXXX"> </a>
over and large boulders piled on top. In several of these graves the
skeletons were in a fair state of preservation, and were removed, as
well as the articles found with them.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mr. William Young, of Grantsville,
a&nbsp;skeleton of a Gosiute, in excellent preservation, was obtained,
and has been presented to the Army Medical Museum. It may be stated that
the examination of the rock cemetery at Farmington showed that the
inhabitants of the eastern slope of the Wahsatch Range, in Great Salt
Lake Valley, followed the mode of rock sepulture from this, the most
northern point visited, to below Parowan, a&nbsp;distance of at least
two hundred miles southward, and it seems that these people occupied the
valley long subsequent to those living near the water courses who
constructed the small mounds on top of which were the rude adobe
dwellings, and in some instances used these huts for burial
purposes.</p>

into the collections of the Bureau of Ethnology linguistic material from
the Alibamu, Hitchiti, Muskoki, and Seneca languages.</p>

<p>Rev. <a name="intro_office_dorsey" id="intro_office_dorsey"><span

Ȼegiha language. Having the aid of a Winnebago Indian for some time he
enlarged his vocabulary of that language and recorded grammatical notes.
He also reported upon works submitted to his examination upon the
Tuscarora, Micmac, and Cherokee languages.</p>

<p>Mr. <a name="intro_office_mooney" id="intro_office_mooney"><span

connected with the Bureau since the early part of the fiscal year, was
also engaged upon linguistic work.</p>


<h5 class="section"><a name="intro_synonymy" id="intro_synonymy">
SYNONYMY OF INDIAN TRIBES.</a></h5>

<p>The Director has before reported in general terms that the most
serious source of perplexity to the student of the history of the North
American Indians is the confusion existing among their tribal names. The
causes of this confusion are various. The Indian names for themselves
have been understood and recorded in diverse ways by the earlier
authors, and have been variously transmitted by the latter. Nicknames
arising from trivial causes, and often without apparent cause, have been
imposed upon many tribes. Names borne by one tribe at some period of its
history have been transferred to another, or to several other distinct
tribes. Typographical errors, and improved
<span class="pagenum">XXXV</span>
<a name="pageXXXV" id="pageXXXV"> </a>
spelling on assumed phonetic grounds, have swelled the number of
synonyms until the investigator of a special tribe often finds himself
in a maze of nomenclatural perplexity.</p>

<p>It has long been the intention of the Director to prepare a work on
tribal names, which so far as possible should refer their confusing
titles to a correct and systematic standard. Delay has been occasioned
chiefly by the fundamental necessity of defining linguistic stocks or
families into which all tribes must be primarily divided; and to
accomplish this, long journeys and laborious field and office
investigations have been required during the whole time since the
establishment of the Bureau. Though a few points still remained in an
unsatisfactory condition, it was considered that a sufficient degree of
accuracy had been attained to allow of the publication for the benefit
of students of a volume devoted to the subject. The preparation of the
plan of such a volume was intrusted to Mr. H.&nbsp;W. Henshaw, late in
the spring of 1885, and in June of that year the work was energetically
begun in accordance with the plans submitted. The preparation of this
work, which to a great extent underlies and is the foundation for every
field of ethnologic investigation among Indians, was considered of such
prime importance that nearly all the available force of the Bureau was
placed upon it, to the suspension of the particular investigations in
which the several officers had been engaged.</p>

<p>In addition to the general charge of the whole work, Mr. Henshaw gave
special attention to the families of the northwest coast from Oregon
northward, including the Eskimo, and also several in California. To Mr.
Albert S. Gatschet the tribes of the southeastern United States,
together with the Pueblo and Yuman tribes, were assigned. The Algonkian
family in all its branches&mdash;by far the most important part of the
whole, so far as the great bulk of literature relating to it is
concerned&mdash;was intrusted to Col. Garrick Mallery and Mr. James
Mooney. They also took charge of the Iroquoian family. Rev. J.&nbsp;O.
Dorsey’s intimate acquaintance with the tribes of the Siouan and Caddoan
families peculiarly fitted him to cope with that part of the work, and
he also undertook the Athapascan tribes.
<span class="pagenum">XXXVI</span>
<a name="pageXXXVI" id="pageXXXVI"> </a>
Dr. W.&nbsp;J. Hoffman worked upon the Shoshonean tribes, aided by the
Director’s personal supervision. Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, to whom was
assigned the California tribes, also gave assistance in other
sections.</p>

<p>Each of the gentlemen named has been able to contribute largely to
the results by his personal experience and investigations in the field,
there being numerous regions concerning which published accounts are
meager and unsatisfactory. The main source of the material to be dealt
with has, however, been necessarily derived from books. A&nbsp;vast
amount of the current literature pertaining to the North American
Indians has been examined, amounting to over one thousand volumes, with
a view to the extraction of the tribal names and the historical data
necessary to fix their precise application.</p>

<p>The work at the present time is well advanced toward completion. The
examination of literature for the collation of synonyms may be regarded
as practically done. The tables of synonymy and the accounts of the
tribes have been completed for more than one-half the number of
linguistic families.</p>

LINGUISTIC FAMILIES OF NORTH AMERICA.</a></h6>

<p>In harmony with custom, three scientific papers accompany this
report, designed to illustrate the nature, methods and spirit of the
researches conducted by the Bureau. The first is on the “Classification
of the North American Languages.” It is by no means a final paper on the
subject, but is intended rather to give an account of the present status
of the subject, and to place before the workers in this field of
scholarship the data now existing and the conclusions already reached,
so as to constitute a point of departure for new work. With this end in
view Mr. Pilling is engaged upon the bibliography of the subject and is
rapidly publishing the same, and Mr. Henshaw is employed on the tribal
synonymy. Altogether it is hoped that this work will inaugurate a new
era in the investigation of the subject by making available the vast
body of
<span class="pagenum">XXXVII</span>
<a name="pageXXXVII" id="pageXXXVII"> </a>
material scattered broadcast through the literature relating to the
North American Indians.</p>

<p>In the course of these ethnic researches an interesting field of
facts has been brought to view relating to the superstitions of the
Indians. Already a very large body of mythology has been
collected&mdash;stories from a great number of tongues which embody the
rude philosophy of tribal thought. Such philosophy or opinion finds its
expression not only in the mythic tales, but in the organization of the
people into society, in their daily life and in their habits and
customs. There is a realm of anthropology in this lower state of mankind
which we call savagery, that is hard to understand from the standpoint
of modern civilization, where science, theology, religion, medicine and
the esthetic arts are developed as more or less discrete subjects. In
savagery these great subjects are blended in one, as they are interwoven
into a vast plexus of thought and action, for mythology is the basis of
philosophy, religion, medicine, and art. In savagery the observed facts
of the universe, relating alike to physical nature and to the
humanities, are explained mythologically, and these mythic conceptions
give rise to a great variety of practices. The acts of life are born of
the opinions held as explanations of the environing world. Thus it is
that philosophy finds expression in a complex system of superstitions,
ceremonies and practices, which together constitute the religion of the
people. The purpose of these practices is to avert calamity and to
secure prosperity in the present life. It is astonishing to find how
little the condition of a life to come is involved. The future beyond
the grave is scarcely heeded, or when recognized it seems not to affect
the daily life of the people to any appreciable degree. That which
occupies the attention of the savage mind relates to the pleasures and
pains, the joys and sorrows of present existence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief motive is derived from the consideration of health
and disease, as the pleasures and pains arising therefrom are forever
present to the experience or observation. Good and evil are also
involved in those gifts of nature to man by which his biotic life is
sustained, his food, drink, clothing
<span class="pagenum">XXXVIII</span>
<a name="pageXXXVIII" id="pageXXXVIII"> </a>
and shelter. These bounties come not in a never-changing stream, but are
apparently fitful and capricious. Seasons of plenty are accented by
seasons of scarcity, and thus prosperity and adversity are strangely
commingled in the history of the people. To secure this prosperity and
avert this adversity seems to be the second great motive in the
development of the superstitious practices of the people. A&nbsp;third
occasion for the development of this primitive religion inheres in the
social organization of mankind, primarily expressed in the love of man
and woman for each other, but finally expressed in all the relations of
kin and kith and in the relations of tribe with tribe. This gives rise
to a very important development of primitive religion, for the savage
man seeks to discover by occult agencies the power of controlling the
love and good will of his kind and the power of averting the effect of
enmity. To attain these ends he invents a vast system of devices, from
love philters to war dances. A&nbsp;fourth region of exploitation in the
realm of the esoteric relates to the origin of life itself, as many of
their practices are designed to secure perpetuity of life by frequent
births and less painful throes.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that life, health, prosperity, and peace are the
ends sought in all this region of human activity as they are presented
in the study of savage life. The opinions held by the people on these
subjects are primarily expressed in speech and organized into tales,
which constitute mythology, and they are expressed in acts, as
ceremonies and observances, which constitute their religion, their
medicine, and their esthetic arts. These arts consist of sculpture and
painting, by which their mythic beings are represented, and they also
consist of dancing, by which religious fervor is produced, and they give
rise to music, romance, poetry, and drama. Thus it is that the esthetic
arts have their origin in mythology. The epic poem and the symphony are
lineal descendants of the dance, and the dance arises as the first form
of worship, born of the mythic conception of the powers of nature.</p>

THE MIDĒ´WIWIN, OR GRAND MEDICINE SOCIETY OF THE OJIBWA, BY W.&nbsp;J.
HOFFMAN, AND THE SACRED FORMULAS OF THE CHEROKEES, BY JAMES
MOONEY.</a></h6>

<p>Mr. Hoffman presents a paper on the “Midē´wiwin, or Grand Medicine
Society of the Ojibwa,” and sets forth the vestiges of a once powerful
organization existing among these people. Mr. Mooney has made a study of
the Cherokee with the same end in view. In the opinion of the Director
they are important contributions to this subject. The same lines of
investigation have been carried on by other members of the Bureau with
other tribes where societies and practices have been but little modified
by the contact of the white man, and where the subject is therefore much
more plainly arrayed. In due time these additional researches will be
published.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hoffman’s paper it is seen that two and a half centuries of
association with the white man has not only served to break down this
organization to some extent, but has also inculcated in the minds of the
Ojibwa a clearer conception of a Great Spirit and a future life than is
normal to the savage mind. Mr. Mooney, whose paper largely deals with
the use of plants by the Indians for the healing of disease, naïvely
compares the pharmacopoeia of savagery with that of civilization,
assuming that the latter is a standard of scientific truth. Perchance
scientific men will make one step in advance of this position, and will
be interested in discovering the extent to which savage philosophy is
still represented in civilized materia medica as expressed in <ins class="correction" title="not an error">officinal</ins> formulas.</p>

<p>A word in relation to the dramatis personæ of Indian mythology. In
all those mythologies which have been studied with any degree of care up
to the present time zoic deities greatly prevail, the progenitors and
prototypes of the animals of the land, air, and water; yet there are
other deities. Chief among these are the sun, moon, stars, fire, and the
spirits of mountains and other geographical and natural phenomena. Yet
these beings are largely zoomorphic, being considered rather as mythic
animals than as mythic men; but it must be understood that the line of
demarcation between man and the lower animals is not so clearly
presented to the savage mind
<span class="pagenum">XL</span>
<a name="pageXL" id="pageXL"> </a>
as to the civilized mind. In speaking of the theology of the North
American Indians as being zoomorphic it must therefore be understood to
mean that such is its chief characteristic, but not its exclusive
characteristic; and further, it must be understood that it contains by
survival many elements from an earlier condition in which hecastotheism
prevailed, that is, that the form of philosophy known as animism was
generally accepted, and that psychic life, with feeling, thought, and
will, was attributed to inanimate things. But more than this, zootheism
is not a permanent state of philosophy, but only a stepping-stone to
something higher. That something higher may be denominated physitheism,
or the worship of the powers and more obtrusive phenomena of nature. In
this higher state the sun, the planets, the stars, the winds, the
storms, the rainbow, and fire take the leading part. The beginnings of
this higher state are to be observed in many of the mythologies of North
America. It is worthy of remark that a mythology with its religion
subject to the influences of an overwhelming civilization yields first
in its zoomorphic elements. Zoic mythology soon degenerates into folk
tales of beasts, to be recited by crones to children or told by
garrulous old men as amusing stories inherited from past generations;
while physitheism is more often incorporated into the compound of
paganism and Christianity now held by the more advanced tribes.
Notwithstanding this general tendency, zootheism is often, though not to
so great an extent, compounded in the same way. The study of this stage
of mythology, and of the arts and customs arising therefrom, as they are
exhibited among the North American Indians, will ultimately throw a
flood of light upon that later stage known as physitheism, or nature
worship, now the subject of investigation by an army of Aryan
scholars.</p>

<h3>INDIAN LINGUISTIC FAMILIES.</h3>

<hr class="tiny">

<h3>By J. W. Powell.</h3>

<hr class="tiny">

<h4>NOMENCLATURE OF LINGUISTIC FAMILIES.</h4>


<p>The languages spoken by the pre-Columbian tribes of North America
were many and diverse. Into the regions occupied by these tribes
travelers, traders, and missionaries have penetrated in advance of
civilization, and civilization itself has marched across the continent
at a rapid rate. Under these conditions the languages of the various
tribes have received much study. Many extensive works have been
published, embracing grammars and dictionaries; but a far greater number
of minor vocabularies have been collected and very many have been
published. In addition to these, the Bible, in whole or in part, and
various religious books and school books, have been translated into
Indian tongues to be used for purposes of instruction; and newspapers
have been published in the Indian languages. Altogether the literature
of these languages and that relating to them are of vast extent.</p>

<p>While the materials seem thus to be abundant, the student of Indian
languages finds the subject to be one requiring most thoughtful
consideration, difficulties arising from the following conditions:</p>

<p>(1) A great number of linguistic stocks or families are
discovered.</p>

<p>(2) The boundaries between the different stocks of languages are not
immediately apparent, from the fact that many tribes of diverse stocks
have had more or less association, and to some extent linguistic
materials have been borrowed, and thus have passed out of the exclusive
possession of cognate peoples.</p>

<p>(3) Where many peoples, each few in number, are thrown together, an
intertribal language is developed. To a large extent this is gesture
speech; but to a limited extent useful and important words are adopted
by various tribes, and out of this material an intertribal “jargon” is
established. Travelers and all others who do not thoroughly study a
language are far more likely to acquire this jargon speech than the real
speech of the people; and the tendency to base relationship upon such
jargons has led to confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">8</span>
<a name="page008" id="page008"> </a>
(4)&nbsp;This tendency to the establishment of intertribal jargons was
greatly accelerated on the advent of the white man, for thereby many
tribes were pushed from their ancestral homes and tribes were mixed with
tribes. As a result, new relations and new industries, especially of
trade, were established, and the new associations of tribe with tribe
and of the Indians with Europeans led very often to the development of
quite elaborate jargon languages. All of these have a tendency to
complicate the study of the Indian tongues by comparative methods.</p>

<p>The difficulties inherent in the study of languages, together with
the imperfect material and the complicating conditions that have arisen
by the spread of civilization over the country, combine to make the
problem one not readily solved.</p>

<p>In view of the amount of material on hand, the comparative study of
the languages of North America has been strangely neglected, though
perhaps this is explained by reason of the difficulties which have been
pointed out. And the attempts which have been made to classify them has
given rise to much confusion, for the following reasons: First, later
authors have not properly recognized the work of earlier laborers in the
field. Second, the attempt has more frequently been made to establish an
ethnic classification than a linguistic classification, and linguistic
characteristics have been confused with biotic peculiarities, arts,
habits, customs, and other human activities, so that radical differences
of language have often been ignored and slight differences have been
held to be of primary value.</p>

<p>The attempts at a classification of these languages and a
corresponding classification of races have led to the development of a
complex, mixed, and inconsistent synonymy, which must first be unraveled
and a selection of standard names made therefrom according to fixed
principles.</p>

<p>It is manifest that until proper rules are recognized by scholars the
establishment of a determinate nomenclature is impossible. It will
therefore be well to set forth the rules that have here been adopted,
together with brief reasons for the same, with the hope that they will
commend themselves to the judgment of other persons engaged in
researches relating to the languages of North America.</p>

<p>A fixed nomenclature in biology has been found not only to be
advantageous, but to be a prerequisite to progress in research, as the
vast multiplicity of facts, still ever accumulating, would otherwise
overwhelm the scholar. In philological classification fixity of
nomenclature is of corresponding importance; and while the analogies
between linguistic and biotic classification are quite limited, many of
the principles of nomenclature which biologists have adopted having no
application in philology, still in some important particulars the
requirements of all scientific classifications are alike,
<span class="pagenum">9</span>
<a name="page009" id="page009"> </a>
and though many of the nomenclatural points met with in biology will not
occur in philology, some of them do occur and may be governed by the
same rules.</p>

<p>Perhaps an ideal nomenclature in biology may some time be
established, as attempts have been made to establish such a system in
chemistry; and possibly such an ideal system may eventually be
established in philology. Be that as it may, the time has not yet come
even for its suggestion. What is now needed is a rule of some kind
leading scholars to use the same terms for the same things, and it would
seem to matter little in the case of linguistic stocks what the
nomenclature is, provided it becomes denotive and universal.</p>

<p>In treating of the languages of North America it has been suggested
that the names adopted should be the names by which the people recognize
themselves, but this is a rule of impossible application, for where the
branches of a stock diverge very greatly no common name for the people
can be found. Again, it has been suggested that names which are to go
permanently into science should be simple and euphonic. This also is
impossible of application, for simplicity and euphony are largely
questions of personal taste, and he who has studied many languages loses
speedily his idiosyncrasies of likes and dislikes and learns that words
foreign to his vocabulary are not necessarily barbaric.</p>

<p>Biologists have decided that he who first distinctly characterizes
and names a species or other group shall thereby cause the name thus
used to become permanently affixed, but under certain conditions adapted
to a growing science which is continually revising its classifications.
This law of priority may well be adopted by philologists.</p>

<p>By the application of the law of priority it will occasionally happen
that a name must be taken which is not wholly unobjectionable or which
could be much improved. But if names may be modified for any reason, the
extent of change that may be wrought in this manner is unlimited, and
such modifications would ultimately become equivalent to the
introduction of new names, and a fixed nomenclature would thereby be
overthrown. The rule of priority has therefore been adopted.</p>

<p>Permanent biologic nomenclature dates from the time of Linnæus simply
because this great naturalist established the binominal system and
placed scientific classification upon a sound and enduring basis. As
Linnæus is to be regarded as the founder of biologic classification, so
Gallatin may be considered the founder of systematic philology relating
to the North American Indians. Before his time much linguistic work had
been accomplished, and scholars owe a lasting debt of gratitude to
Barton, Adelung, Pickering, and others. But Gallatin’s work marks an era
in American linguistic science from the fact that he so thoroughly
introduced comparative methods, and because he circumscribed the
boundaries of many
<span class="pagenum">10</span>
<a name="page010" id="page010"> </a>
families, so that a large part of his work remains and is still to be
considered sound. There is no safe resting place anterior to Gallatin,
because no scholar prior to his time had properly adopted comparative
methods of research, and because no scholar was privileged to work with
so large a body of material. It must further be said of Gallatin that he
had a very clear conception of the task he was performing, and brought
to it both learning and wisdom. Gallatin’s work has therefore been taken
as the starting point, back of which we may not go in the historic
consideration of the systematic philology of North America. The point of
departure therefore is the year 1836, when Gallatin’s “Synopsis of
Indian Tribes” appeared in vol. 2 of the Transactions of the American
Antiquarian Society.</p>

<p>It is believed that a name should be simply a denotive word, and that
no advantage can accrue from a descriptive or connotive title. It is
therefore desirable to have the names as simple as possible, consistent
with other and more important considerations. For this reason it has
been found impracticable to recognize as family names designations based
on several distinct terms, such as descriptive phrases, and words
compounded from two or more geographic names. Such phrases and compound
words have been rejected.</p>

<p>There are many linguistic families in North America, and in a number
of them there are many tribes speaking diverse languages. It is
important, therefore, that some form should be given to the family name
by which it may be distinguished from the name of a single tribe or
language. In many cases some one language within a stock has been taken
as the type and its name given to the entire family; so that the name of
a language and that of the stock to which it belongs are identical. This
is inconvenient and leads to confusion. For such reasons it has been
decided to give each family name the termination “an” or “ian.”</p>

<p>Conforming to the principles thus enunciated, the following rules
have been formulated:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>I. The law of priority relating to the nomenclature of the systematic
philology of the North American tribes shall not extend to authors whose
works are of date anterior to the year 1836.</p>

<p>II. The name originally given by the founder of a linguistic group to
designate it as a family or stock of languages shall be permanently
retained to the exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>III. No family name shall be recognized if composed of more than one
word.</p>

<p>IV. A family name once established shall not be canceled in any
subsequent division of the group, but shall be retained in a restricted
sense for one of its constituent portions.</p>

<p>V. Family names shall be distinguished as such by the termination “an”
or “ian.”</p>

<span class="pagenum">11</span>
<a name="page011" id="page011"> </a>
<p>VI. No name shall be accepted for a linguistic family unless used to
designate a tribe or group of tribes as a linguistic stock.</p>

<p>VII. No family name shall be accepted unless there is given the habitat
of tribe or tribes to which it is applied.</p>

<p>VIII. The original orthography of a name shall be rigidly preserved
except as provided for in rule III, and unless a typographical error is
evident.</p>
</div>

<p>The terms “family” and “stock” are here applied interchangeably to a
group of languages that are supposed to be cognate.</p>

<p>A single language is called a stock or family when it is not found to
be cognate with any other language. Languages are said to be cognate
when such relations between them are found that they are supposed to
have descended from a common ancestral speech. The evidence of cognation
is derived exclusively from the vocabulary. Grammatic similarities are
not supposed to furnish evidence of cognation, but to be phenomena, in
part relating to stage of culture and in part adventitious. It must be
remembered that extreme peculiarities of grammar, like the vocal
mutations of the Hebrew or the monosyllabic separation of the Chinese,
have not been discovered among Indian tongues. It therefore becomes
necessary in the classification of Indian languages into families to
neglect grammatic structure, and to consider lexical elements only. But
this statement must be clearly understood. It is postulated that in the
growth of languages new words are formed by combination, and that these
new words change by attrition to secure economy of utterance, and also
by assimilation (analogy) for economy of thought. In the comparison of
languages for the purposes of systematic philology it often becomes
necessary to dismember compounded words for the purpose of comparing the
more primitive forms thus obtained. The paradigmatic words considered in
grammatic treatises may often be the very words which should be
dissected to discover in their elements primary affinities. But the
comparison is still lexic, not grammatic.</p>

<p>A lexic comparison is between vocal elements; a grammatic comparison
is between grammatic methods, such, for example, as gender systems. The
classes into which things are relegated by distinction of gender may be
animate and inanimate, and the animate may subsequently be divided into
male and female, and these two classes may ultimately absorb, in part at
least, inanimate things. The growth of a system of genders may take
another course. The animate and inanimate may be subdivided into the
standing, the sitting, and the lying, or into the moving, the erect and
the reclined; or, still further, the superposed classification may be
based upon the supposed constitution of things, as the fleshy, the
woody, the rocky, the earthy, the watery. Thus the number of genders may
increase, while further on in the history of a language the genders may
<span class="pagenum">12</span>
<a name="page012" id="page012"> </a>
decrease so as almost to disappear. All of these characteristics are in
part adventitious, but to a large extent the gender is a phenomenon of
growth, indicating the stage to which the language has attained. A
proper case system may not have been established in a language by the
fixing of case particles, or, having been established, it may change by
the increase or diminution of the number of cases. A tense system also
has a beginning, a growth, and a decadence. A mode system is variable in
the various stages of the history of a language. In like manner a
pronominal system undergoes changes. Particles may be prefixed, infixed,
or affixed in compounded words, and which one of these methods will
finally prevail can be determined only in the later stage of growth. All
of these things are held to belong to the grammar of a language and to
be grammatic methods, distinct from lexical elements.</p>

<p>With terms thus defined, languages are supposed to be cognate when
fundamental similarities are discovered in their lexical elements. When
the members of a family of languages are to be classed in subdivisions
and the history of such languages investigated, grammatic
characteristics become of primary importance. The words of a language
change by the methods described, but the fundamental elements or roots
are more enduring. Grammatic methods also change, perhaps even more
rapidly than words, and the changes may go on to such an extent that
primitive methods are entirely lost, there being no radical grammatic
elements to be preserved. Grammatic structure is but a phase or accident
of growth, and not a primordial element of language. The roots of a
language are its most permanent characteristics, and while the words
which are formed from them may change so as to obscure their elements or
in some cases even to lose them, it seems that they are never lost from
all, but can be recovered in large part. The grammatic structure or plan
of a language is forever changing, and in this respect the language may
become entirely transformed.</p>

LITERATURE RELATING TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF
INDIAN LANGUAGES.</a></h4>

<p>While the literature relating to the languages of North America is
very extensive, that which relates to their classification is much less
extensive. For the benefit of future students in this line it is thought
best to present a concise account of such literature, or at least so
much as has been consulted in the preparation of this paper.</p>

America. In Transactions and Collections of the American Antiquarian

</div>

<p>The larger part of the volume consists of Gallatin’s paper. A short
chapter is devoted to general observations, including certain
<span class="pagenum">13</span>
<a name="page013" id="page013"> </a>
historical data, and the remainder to the discussion of linguistic
material and the affinities of the various tribes mentioned.
Vocabularies of many of the families are appended. Twenty-eight
linguistic divisions are recognized in the general table of the tribes.
Some of these divisions are purely geographic, such as the tribes of
Salmon River, Queen Charlotte’s Island, etc. Vocabularies from these
localities were at hand, but of their linguistic relations the author
was not sufficiently assured. Most of the linguistic families recognized
by Gallatin were defined with much precision. Not all of his conclusions
are to be accepted in the presence of the data now at hand, but usually
they were sound, as is attested by the fact that they have constituted
the basis for much classificatory work since his time.</p>

<p>The primary, or at least the ostensible, purpose of the colored map
which accompanies Gallatin’s paper was, as indicated by its title, to
show the distribution of the tribes, and accordingly their names appear
upon it, and not the names of the linguistic families. Nevertheless, it
is practically a map of the linguistic families as determined by the
author, and it is believed to be the first attempted for the area
represented. Only eleven of the twenty-eight families named in this
table appear, and these represent the families with which he was best
acquainted. As was to be expected from the early period at which the map
was constructed, much of the western part of the United States was left
uncolored. Altogether the map illustrates well the state of knowledge of
the time.</p>

<p>In Chapter <span class="smallroman">XXII</span> of this volume the
author gives a brief synopsis of the Indian tribes east of the
Mississippi, under a linguistic classification, and adds a brief account
of the character and methods of Indian languages. A linguistic map of
the region is incorporated, which in general corresponds with the one
published by Gallatin in 1836. A notable addition to the Gallatin map is
the inclusion of the Uchees in their proper locality. Though considered
a distinct family by Gallatin, this tribe does not appear upon his map.
Moreover, the Choctaws and Muskogees, which appear as separate families
upon Gallatin’s map (though believed by that author to belong to the
same family), are united upon Bancroft’s map under the term
Mobilian.</p>

treats. In his account Scouler is guided chiefly, to use his own words,
“by&nbsp;considerations founded on their physical character, manners and
customs, and on the affinities of their languages.” As the linguistic
considerations are mentioned last, so they appear to be the least
weighty of his “considerations.”</p>

<p>Scouler’s definition of a family is very broad indeed, and in his
“Northern Family,” which is a branch of his “Insular Group,” he includes
such distinct linguistic stocks as “all the Indian tribes in the Russian
territory,” the Queen Charlotte Islanders, Koloshes, Ugalentzes, Atnas,
Kolchans, Kenáïes, Tun Ghaase, Haidahs, and Chimmesyans. His
Nootka-Columbian family is scarcely less incongruous, and it is evident
that the classification indicated is only to a comparatively slight
extent linguistic.</p>

<p>In this article, which was read before the Philological Society,
January 24, 1845, a large number of North American languages are
examined and their affinities discussed in support of the two following
postulates made at the beginning of the paper: First, “No&nbsp;American
language has an isolated position when compared with the other tongues
en masse rather than with the language of any particular class;” second,
“The affinities between the language of the New World, as determined by
their <i>vocabularies</i>, is not less real than that inferred from the
analogies of their <i>grammatical structure</i>.” The author’s
conclusions are that both statements are substantiated by the evidence
presented. The paper contains no new family names.</p>

<p>It was the purpose of this author, as avowed by himself, to determine

consideration of a great number of subjects and led to the accumulation
of a vast body of facts. In volume 5 the author treats of the American
Indians, and in connection with the different tribes has something to
say of their languages. No attempt at an original classification is
made, and in the main the author follows Gallatin’s classification and
adopts his conclusions.</p>

<p>This paper was read before the Ethnological Society on the 11th of
December. The languages noticed are those that lie between “Russian
America and New California,” of which the author aims to give an
exhaustive list. He discusses the value of the groups to which these
languages have been assigned, viz, Athabascan and Nootka-Columbian, and
finds that they have been given too high value, and that they are only
equivalent to the primary subdivisions of <i>stocks</i>, like the
Gothic, Celtic, and Classical, rather than to the stocks themselves. He
further finds that the Athabascan, the Kolooch, the Nootka-Columbian,
and the Cadiak groups are subordinate members of one large and important

<p>This, the first edition of this well known atlas, contains, among
other maps, an ethnographic map of North America, made in 1845. It is
based, as is stated, upon material derived from Gallatin, Humboldt,
Clavigero, Hervas, Vater, and others. So far as the eastern part of the
United States is concerned it is largely a duplication of Gallatin’s map
of 1836, while in the western region a certain amount of new material is
incorporated.</p>

Its eastern portion is substantially a copy of the earlier edition, but
its western half is materially changed, chiefly in accordance with the
knowledge supplied by Hall in 1848.</p>

<p>Map number 72 of the last edition of Berghaus by no means marks an
advance upon the edition of 1852. Apparently the number of families is
much reduced, but it is very difficult to interpret the meaning of the

divisions and tribal habitats with the result that confusion is made
worse confounded.</p>

<p>The above, forming a second supplemental volume of the Transactions
for 1854, is an extensive compilation of much previous literature
treating of the Indian tribes from the Arctic Ocean southward to
Guadalajara, and bears specially upon the Aztec language and its traces
in the languages of the numerous tribes scattered along the Pacific
Ocean and inland to the high plains. A large number of vocabularies and
a vast amount of linguistic material are here brought together and
arranged in a comprehensive manner to aid in the study attempted. In his
classification of the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains, Buschmann
largely followed Gallatin. His treatment of those not included in
Gallatin’s paper is in the main original. Many of the results obtained
may have been considered bold at the time of publication, but recent
philological investigations give evidence of the value of many of the
author’s conclusions.</p>

<p>The interesting account of the author’s travels among the Indians,
chiefly in the Northwest, and of their habits, is followed by a four
page supplement, giving the names, locations, and census of the tribes
of the Northwest coast. They are classified by language into Chymseyan,
including the Nass, Chymseyans, Skeena and Sabassas Indians, of whom
twenty-one tribes are given; Ha-eelb-zuk or Ballabola, including the
Milbank Sound Indians, with nine tribes; Klen-ekate, including twenty
tribes; Hai-dai, including the Kygargey and Queen Charlotte’s Island
Indians, nineteen tribes being enumerated; and Qua-colth, with
twenty-nine tribes. No statement of the origin of these tables is given,
and they reappear, with no explanation, in Schoolcraft’s Indian Tribes,
volume <span class="smallroman">V</span>, pp.&nbsp;487-489.</p>

<p>In his Queen Charlotte Islands, 1870, Dawson publishes the part of
this table relating to the Haida, with the statement that he received it
from Dr. W.&nbsp;F. Tolmie. The census was made in 1836-’41 by the late
Mr. John Work, who doubtless was the author of the more complete tables
published by Kane and Schoolcraft.</p>

ensayo de clasificacion de las mismas lenguas y de apuntes para las
inmigraciones de las tribus. Mexico, 1864.</p>
</div>

<p>The work is divided into three parts. (1)&nbsp;Tentative
classification of the languages of Mexico; (2)&nbsp;notes on the
immigration of the tribes of Mexico; (3)&nbsp;geography of the languages
of Mexico.</p>

<p>The author states that he has no knowledge whatever of the languages
he treats of. All he attempts to do is to summarize the opinions of
others. His authorities were (1)&nbsp;writers on native grammars;
(2)&nbsp;missionaries; (3)&nbsp;persons who are reputed to be versed in
such matters. He professes to have used his own judgment only when these
authorities left him free to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>His stated method in compiling the ethnographic map was to place
before him the map of a certain department, examine all his authorities
bearing on that department, and to mark with a distinctive color all
localities said to belong to a particular language. When this was done
he drew a boundary line around the area of that language. Examination of
the map shows that he has partly expressed on it the classification of
languages as given in the first part of his text, and partly limited
himself to indicating the geographic boundaries
<span class="pagenum">21</span>
<a name="page021" id="page021"> </a>
of languages, without, however, giving the boundaries of all the
languages mentioned in his lists.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the introduction this work is divided into three parts:
(1)&nbsp;descriptive; (2)&nbsp;comparative; (3)&nbsp;critical.</p>

<p>The author divides the treatment of each language into (1)&nbsp;its
mechanism; (2)&nbsp;its dictionary; (3)&nbsp;its grammar.
By “mechanism” he means
pronunciation and composition; by “dictionary” he means the commonest or
most notable words.</p>

<p>In the case of each language he states the localities where it is
spoken, giving a short sketch of its history, the explanation of its
etymology, and a list of such writers on that language as he has become
acquainted with. Then follows: “mechanism, dictionary, and grammar.”
Next he enumerates its dialects if there are any, and compares specimens
of them when he is able. He gives the Our Father when he can.</p>

<p>Volume <span class="smallroman">I</span> (1862) contains
introduction and twelve languages. Volume <span class="smallroman">II</span> (1865) contains fourteen groups of languages, a
vocabulary of the Opata language, and an appendix treating of the
Comanche, the Coahuilteco, and various languages of upper
California.</p>

<p>Volume <span class="smallroman">III</span> (announced in preface of
Volume <span class="smallroman">II</span>) is to contain the
“comparative part” (to be treated in the same “mixed” method as the
“descriptive part”), and a scientific classification of all the
languages spoken in Mexico.</p>

<p>In the “critical part” (apparently dispersed through the other two
parts) the author intends to pass judgment on the merits of the
languages of Mexico, to point out their good qualities and their
defects.</p>

<p>In this important paper is presented much interesting information
concerning the inhabitants of Alaska and adjacent territories. The
natives are divided into two groups, the Indians of the interior, and
the inhabitants of the coast, or Esquimaux. The latter are designated by
the term Orarians, which are composed of three lesser groups, Eskimo,
Aleutians, and Tuski. The Orarians are distinguished, first, by their
language; second, by their distribution; third, by their habits; fourth,
by their physical characteristics.</p>

the Innuit, comprising all the so-called Eskimo and Tuskis, and the

In 1836 Gallatin conferred a great boon upon linguistic students by
classifying all the existing material relating to this subject. Even in
the light of the knowledge of the present day his work is found to rest
upon a sound basis. The material of Gallatin’s time, however, was too
scanty to permit of more than an outline of the subject. Later writers
have contributed to the work, and the names of Latham, Turner, Prichard,
Buschmann, Hale, Gatschet, and others are connected with important
classificatory results.</p>

<p>The writer’s interest in linguistic work and the inception of a plan
for a linguistic classification of Indian languages date back about 20
years, to a time when he was engaged in explorations in the West. Being
brought into contact with many tribes, it was possible to collect a
large amount of original material. Subsequently, when the Bureau of
Ethnology was organized, this store was largely increased through the
labors of others. Since then a very large body of literature published
in Indian languages has been accumulated, and a great number of
vocabularies have been gathered by the Bureau
<span class="pagenum">26</span>
<a name="page026" id="page026"> </a>
assistants and by collaborators in various parts of the country. The
results of a study of all this material, and of much historical data,
which necessarily enters largely into work of this character, appear in
the accompanying map.</p>

<p>The contributions to the subject during the last fifty years have
been so important, and the additions to the material accessible to the
student of Gallatin’s time have been so large, that much of the reproach
which deservedly attached to American scholars because of the neglect of
American linguistics has been removed. The field is a vast one, however,
and the workers are comparatively few. Moreover, opportunities for
collecting linguistic material are growing fewer day by day, as tribes
are consolidated upon reservations, as they become civilized, and as the
older Indians, who alone are skilled in their language, die, leaving, it
may be, only a few imperfect vocabularies as a basis for future study.
History has bequeathed to us the names of many tribes, which became
extinct in early colonial times, of whose language not a hint is left
and whose linguistic relations must ever remain unknown.</p>

<p>It is vain to grieve over neglected opportunities unless their
contemplation stimulates us to utilize those at hand. There are yet many
gaps to be filled, even in so elementary a part of the study as the
classification of the tribes by language. As to the detailed study of
the different linguistic families, the mastery and analysis of the
languages composing them, and their comparison with one another and with
the languages of other families, only a beginning has been made.</p>

<p>After the above statement it is hardly necessary to add that the
accompanying map does not purport to represent final results. On the
contrary, it is to be regarded as tentative, setting forth in visible
form the results of investigation up to the present time, as a guide and
aid to future effort.</p>

<p>Each of the colors or patterns upon the map represents a distinct
linguistic family, the total number of families contained in the whole
area being fifty-eight. It is believed that the families of languages
represented upon the map can not have sprung from a common source; they
are as distinct from one another in their vocabularies and apparently in
their origin as from the Aryan or the Scythian families. Unquestionably,
future and more critical study will result in the fusion of some of
these families. As the means for analysis and comparison accumulate,
resemblances now hidden will be brought to light, and relationships
hitherto unsuspected will be shown to exist. Such a result may be
anticipated with the more certainty inasmuch as the present
classification has been made upon a conservative plan. Where
relationships between families are suspected, but can not be
demonstrated by convincing evidence, it has been deemed wiser not to
unite them, but to keep
<span class="pagenum">27</span>
<a name="page027" id="page027"> </a>
them apart until more material shall have accumulated and proof of a
more convincing character shall have been brought forward. While some of
the families indicated on the map may in future be united to other
families, and the number thus be reduced, there seems to be no ground
for the belief that the total of the linguistic families of this country
will be materially diminished, at least under the present methods of
linguistic analysis, for there is little reason to doubt that, as the
result of investigation in the field, there will be discovered tribes
speaking languages not classifiable under any of the present families;
thus the decrease in the total by reason of consolidation may be
compensated by a corresponding increase through discovery. It may even
be possible that some of the similarities used in combining languages
into families may, on further study, prove to be adventitious, and the
number may be increased thereby. To which side the numerical balance
will fall remains for the future to decide.</p>

<p>As stated above, all the families occupy the same basis of
dissimilarity from one another&mdash;i.e., none of them are
related&mdash;and consequently no two of them are either more or less
alike than any other two, except in so far as mere coincidences and
borrowed material may be said to constitute likeness and relationship.
Coincidences in the nature of superficial word resemblances are common
in all languages of the world. No matter how widely separated
geographically two families of languages may be, no matter how unlike
their vocabularies, how distinct their origin, some words may always be
found which appear upon superficial examination to indicate
relationship. There is not a single Indian linguistic family, for
instance, which does not contain words similar in sound, and more rarely
similar in both sound and meaning, to words in English, Chinese, Hebrew,
and other languages. Not only do such resemblances exist, but they have
been discovered and pointed out, not as mere adventitious similarities,
but as proof of genetic relationship. Borrowed linguistic material also
appears in every family, tempting the unwary investigator into making
false analogies and drawing erroneous conclusions. Neither coincidences
nor borrowed material, however, can be properly regarded as evidence of
cognation.</p>

<p>While occupying the same plane of genetic dissimilarity, the families
are by no means alike as regards either the extent of territory
occupied, the number of tribes grouped under them respectively, or the
number of languages and dialects of which they are composed. Some of
them cover wide areas, whose dimensions are stated in terms of latitude
and longitude rather than by miles. Others occupy so little space that
the colors representing them are hardly discernible upon the map. Some
of them contain but a single tribe; others are represented by scores of
tribes. In the case of a few, the term “family” is commensurate with
language, since there is but one
<span class="pagenum">28</span>
<a name="page028" id="page028"> </a>
language and no dialects. In the case of others, their tribes spoke
several languages, so distinct from one another as to be for the most
part mutually unintelligible, and the languages shade into many dialects
more or less diverse.</p>

<p>The map, designed primarily for the use of students who are engaged
in investigating the Indians of the United States, was at first limited
to this area; subsequently its scope was extended to include the whole
of North America north of Mexico. Such an extension of its plan was,
indeed, almost necessary, since a number of important families, largely
represented in the United States, are yet more largely represented in
the territory to the north, and no adequate conception of the size and
relative importance of such families as the Algonquian, Siouan,
Salishan, Athapascan, and others can be had without including
extralimital territory.</p>

<p>To the south, also, it happens that several linguistic stocks extend
beyond the boundaries of the United States. Three families are, indeed,
mainly extralimital in their position, viz: Yuman, the great body of the
tribes of which family inhabited the peninsula of Lower California;
Piman, which has only a small representation in southern Arizona; and
the Coahuiltecan, which intrudes into southwestern Texas. The Athapascan
family is represented in Arizona and New Mexico by the well known Apache
and Navajo, the former of whom have gained a strong foothold in northern
Mexico, while the Tañoan, a Pueblo family of the upper Rio Grande, has
established a few pueblos lower down the river in Mexico. For the
purpose of necessary comparison, therefore, the map is made to include
all of North America north of Mexico, the entire peninsula of Lower
California, and so much of Mexico as is necessary to show the range of
families common to that country and to the United States. It is left to
a future occasion to attempt to indicate the linguistic relations of
Mexico and Central America, for which, it may be remarked in passing,
much material has been accumulated.</p>

<p>It is apparent that a single map can not be made to show the
locations of the several linguistic families at different epochs; nor
can a single map be made to represent the migrations of the tribes
composing the linguistic families. In order to make a clear presentation
of the latter subject, it would be necessary to prepare a series of maps
showing the areas successively occupied by the several tribes as they
were disrupted and driven from section to section under the pressure of
other tribes or the vastly more potent force of European encroachment.
Although the data necessary for a complete representation of tribal
migration, even for the period subsequent to the advent of the European,
does not exist, still a very large body of material bearing upon the
subject is at hand, and exceedingly valuable results in this direction
could be presented did not the amount
<span class="pagenum">29</span>
<a name="page029" id="page029"> </a>
of time and labor and the large expense attendant upon such a project
forbid the attempt for the present.</p>

<p>The map undertakes to show the habitat of the linguistic families
only, and this is for but a single period in their history, viz, at the
time when the tribes composing them first became known to the European,
or when they first appear on recorded history. As the dates when the
different tribes became known vary, it follows as a matter of course
that the periods represented by the colors in one portion of the map are
not synchronous with those in other portions. Thus the data for the
Columbia River tribes is derived chiefly from the account of the journey
of Lewis and Clarke in 1803-’05, long before which period radical
changes of location had taken place among the tribes of the eastern
United States. Again, not only are the periods represented by the
different sections of the map not synchronous, but only in the case of a
few of the linguistic families, and these usually the smaller ones, is
it possible to make the coloring synchronous for different sections of
the same family. Thus our data for the location of some of the northern
members of the Shoshonean family goes back to 1804, a date at which
absolutely no knowledge had been gained of most of the southern members
of the group, our first accounts of whom began about 1850. Again, our
knowledge of the eastern Algonquian tribes dates back to about 1600,
while no information was had concerning the Atsina, Blackfeet, Cheyenne,
and the Arapaho, the westernmost members of the family, until two
centuries later.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these facts, an attempt to fix upon the areas
formerly occupied by the several linguistic families, and of the
pristine homes of many of the tribes composing them, is by no means
hopeless. For instance, concerning the position of the western tribes
during the period of early contact of our colonies and its agreement
with their position later when they appear in history, it may be
inferred that as a rule it was stationary, though positive evidence is
lacking. When changes of tribal habitat actually took place they were
rarely in the nature of extensive migration, by which a portion of a
linguistic family was severed from the main body, but usually in the
form of encroachment by a tribe or tribes upon neighboring territory,
which resulted simply in the extension of the limits of one linguistic
family at the expense of another, the defeated tribes being incorporated
or confined within narrower limits. If the above inference be correct,
the fact that different chronologic periods are represented upon the map
is of comparatively little importance, since, if the Indian tribes were
in the main sedentary, and not nomadic, the changes resulting in the
course of one or two centuries would not make material differences.
Exactly the opposite opinion, however, has been expressed by many
writers, viz, that the North
<span class="pagenum">30</span>
<a name="page030" id="page030"> </a>
American Indian tribes were nomadic. The picture presented by these
writers is of a medley of ever-shifting tribes, to-day here, to-morrow
there, occupying new territory and founding new homes&mdash;if nomads
can be said to have homes&mdash;only to abandon them. Such a picture,
however, is believed to convey an erroneous idea of the former condition
of our Indian tribes. As the question has significance in the present
connection it must be considered somewhat at length.</p>

<h5><a name="page030b" id="page030b">INDIAN TRIBES SEDENTARY.</a></h5>

<p>In the first place, the linguistic map, based as it is upon the
earliest evidence obtainable, itself offers conclusive proof, not only
that the Indian tribes were in the main sedentary at the time history
first records their position, but that they had been sedentary for a
very long period. In order that this may be made plain, it should be
clearly understood, as stated above, that each of the colors or patterns
upon the map indicates a distinct linguistic family. It will be noticed
that the colors representing the several families are usually in single
bodies, i.e., that they represent continuous areas, and that with some
exceptions the same color is not scattered here and there over the map
in small spots. Yet precisely this last state of things is what would be
expected had the tribes representing the families been nomadic to a
marked degree. If nomadic tribes occupied North America, instead of
spreading out each from a common center, as the colors show that the
tribes composing the several families actually did, they would have been
dispersed here and there over the whole face of the country. That they
are not so dispersed is considered proof that in the main they were
sedentary. It has been stated above that more or less extensive
migrations of some tribes over the country had taken place prior to
European occupancy. This fact is disclosed by a glance at the present
map. The great Athapascan family, for instance, occupying the larger
part of British America, is known from linguistic evidence to have sent
off colonies into Oregon (Wilopah, Tlatskanai, Coquille), California
(Smith River tribes, Kenesti or Wailakki tribes, Hupa), and Arizona and
New Mexico (Apache, Navajo). How long before European occupancy of this
country these migrations took place can not be told, but in the case of
most of them it was undoubtedly many years. By the test of language it
is seen that the great Siouan family, which we have come to look upon as
almost exclusively western, had one offshoot in Virginia (Tutelo),
another in North and South Carolina (Catawba), and a third in
Mississippi (Biloxi); and the Algonquian family, so important in the
early history of this country, while occupying a nearly continuous area
in the north and east, had yet secured a foothold, doubtless in very
recent times, in Wyoming and Colorado. These and other
<span class="pagenum">31</span>
<a name="page031" id="page031"> </a>
similar facts sufficiently prove the power of individual tribes or
gentes to sunder relations with the great body of their kindred and to
remove to distant homes. Tested by linguistic evidence, such instances
appear to be exceptional, and the fact remains that in the great
majority of cases the tribes composing linguistic families occupy
continuous areas, and hence are and have been practically sedentary. Nor
is the bond of a common language, strong and enduring as that bond is
usually thought to be, entirely sufficient to explain the phenomenon
here pointed out. When small in number the linguistic tie would
undoubtedly aid in binding together the members of a tribe; but as the
people speaking a common language increase in number and come to have
conflicting interests, the linguistic tie has often proved to be an
insufficient bond of union. In the case of our Indian tribes feuds and
internecine conflicts were common between members of the same linguistic
family. In fact, it is probable that a very large number of the dialects
into which Indian languages are split originated as the result of
internecine strife. Factions, divided and separated from the parent
body, by contact, intermarriage, and incorporation with foreign tribes,
developed distinct dialects or languages.</p>

<p>But linguistic evidence alone need not be relied upon to prove that
the North American Indian was not nomadic.</p>

<p>Corroborative proof of the sedentary character of our Indian tribes
is to be found in the curious form of kinship system, with <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘mother-rite’">mother-right</ins>
as its chief factor, which prevails. This, as has been pointed out in
another place, is not adapted to the necessities of nomadic tribes,
which need to be governed by a patriarchal system, and, as well, to be
possessed of flocks and herds.</p>

<p>There is also an abundance of historical evidence to show that, when
first discovered by Europeans, the Indians of the eastern United States
were found living in fixed habitations. This does not necessarily imply
that the entire year was spent in one place. Agriculture not being
practiced to an extent sufficient to supply the Indian with full
subsistence, he was compelled to make occasional changes from his
permanent home to the more or less distant waters and forests to procure
supplies of food. When furnished with food and skins for clothing, the
hunting parties returned to the village which constituted their true
home. At longer periods, for several reasons&mdash;among which probably
the chief were the hostility of stronger tribes, the failure of the fuel
supply near the village, and the compulsion exercised by the ever lively
superstitious fancies of the Indians&mdash;the villages were abandoned
and new ones formed to constitute new homes, new focal points from which
to set out on their annual hunts and to which to return when these were
completed. The tribes of the eastern United States had fixed and
definitely bounded habitats, and their wanderings were in the nature of
temporary excursions to
<span class="pagenum">32</span>
<a name="page032" id="page032"> </a>
established points resorted to from time immemorial. As, however, they
had not yet entered completely into the agricultural condition, to which
they were fast progressing from the hunter state, they may be said to
have been nomadic to a very limited extent. The method of life thus
sketched was substantially the one which the Indians were found
practicing throughout the eastern part of the United States, as also,
though to a less degree, in the Pacific States. Upon the Pacific coast
proper the tribes were even more sedentary than upon the Atlantic, as
the mild climate and the great abundance and permanent supply of fish
and shellfish left no cause for a seasonal change of abode.</p>

<p>When, however, the interior portions of the country were first
visited by Europeans, a different state of affairs was found to prevail.
There the acquisition of the horse and the possession of firearms had
wrought very great changes in aboriginal habits. The acquisition of the
former enabled the Indian of the treeless plains to travel distances
with ease and celerity which before were practically impossible, and the
possession of firearms stimulated tribal aggressiveness to the utmost
pitch. Firearms were everywhere doubly effective in producing changes in
tribal habitats, since the somewhat gradual introduction of trade placed
these deadly weapons in the hands of some tribes, and of whole congeries
of tribes, long before others could obtain them. Thus the general state
of tribal equilibrium which had before prevailed was rudely disturbed.
Tribal warfare, which hitherto had been attended with inconsiderable
loss of life and slight territorial changes, was now made terribly
destructive, and the territorial possessions of whole groups of tribes
were augmented at the expense of those less fortunate. The horse made
wanderers of many tribes which there is sufficient evidence to show were
formerly nearly sedentary. Firearms enforced migration and caused
wholesale changes in the habitats of tribes, which, in the natural order
of events, it would have taken many centuries to produce. The changes
resulting from these combined agencies, great as they were, are,
however, slight in comparison with the tremendous effects of the
wholesale occupancy of Indian territory by Europeans. As the acquisition
of territory by the settlers went on, a wave of migration from east to
west was inaugurated which affected tribes far remote from the point of
disturbance, ever forcing them within narrower and narrower bounds, and,
as time went on, producing greater and greater changes throughout the
entire country.</p>

<p>So much of the radical change in tribal habitats as took place in the
area remote from European settlements, mainly west of the Mississippi,
is chiefly unrecorded, save imperfectly in Indian tradition, and is
chiefly to be inferred from linguistic evidence and from the few facts
in our possession. As, however, the most important of these changes
occurred after, and as a result of, European
<span class="pagenum">33</span>
<a name="page033" id="page033"> </a>
occupancy, they are noted in history, and thus the map really gives a
better idea of the pristine or prehistoric habitat of the tribes than at
first might be thought possible.</p>

<p>Before speaking of the method of establishing the boundary lines
between the linguistic families, as they appear upon the map, the nature
of the Indian claim to land and the manner and extent of its occupation
should be clearly set forth.</p>

<h5><a name="page033b" id="page033b">POPULATION.</a></h5>

<p>As the question of the Indian population of the country has a direct
bearing upon the extent to which the land was actually occupied, a few
words on the subject will be introduced here, particularly as the area
included in the linguistic map is so covered with color that it may
convey a false impression of the density of the Indian population. As a
result of an investigation of the subject of the early Indian
population, Col. Mallery long ago arrived at the conclusion that their
settlements were not numerous, and that the population, as compared with
the enormous territory occupied, was extremely small.<a class="tag" name="tag1" id="tag1" href="#note1">1</a></p>

<p>Careful examination since the publication of the above tends to
corroborate the soundness of the conclusions there first formulated. The
subject may be set forth as follows:</p>

<p>The sea shore, the borders of lakes, and the banks of rivers, where
fish and shell-fish were to be obtained in large quantities, were
naturally the Indians’ chief resort, and at or near such places were to
be found their permanent settlements. As the settlements and lines of
travel of the early colonists were along the shore, the lakes and the
rivers, early estimates of the Indian population were chiefly based upon
the numbers congregated along these highways, it being generally assumed
that away from the routes of travel a like population existed. Again,
over-estimates of population resulted from the fact that the same body
of Indians visited different points during the year, and not
infrequently were counted two or three times; change of permanent
village sites also tended to augment estimates of population.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons a greatly exaggerated idea of the Indian
population was obtained, and the impressions so derived have been
dissipated only in comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>As will be stated more fully later, the Indian was dependent to no
small degree upon natural products for his food supply. Could it be
affirmed that the North American Indians had increased to a point where
they pressed upon the food supply, it would imply a very much larger
population than we are justified in assuming from other considerations.
But for various reasons the Malthusian law,
<span class="pagenum">34</span>
<a name="page034" id="page034"> </a>
whether applicable elsewhere or not, can not be applied to the Indians
of this country. Everywhere bountiful nature had provided an unfailing
and practically inexhaustible food supply. The rivers teemed with fish
and mollusks, and the forests with game, while upon all sides was an
abundance of nutritious roots and seeds. All of these sources were
known, and to a large extent they were drawn upon by the Indian, but the
practical lesson of providing in the season of plenty for the season of
scarcity had been but imperfectly learned, or, when learned, was but
partially applied. Even when taught by dire experience the necessity of
laying up adequate stores, it was the almost universal practice to waste
great quantities of food by a constant succession of feasts, in the
superstitious observances of which the stores were rapidly wasted and
plenty soon gave way to scarcity and even to famine.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the hospitality which is so marked a trait among
our North American Indians had its source in a law, the invariable
practice of which has had a marked effect in retarding the acquisition
by the Indian of the virtue of providence. As is well known, the basis
of the Indian social organization was the kinship system. By its
provisions almost all property was possessed in common by the gens or
clan. Food, the most important of all, was by no means left to be
exclusively enjoyed by the individual or the family obtaining&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For instance, the distribution of game among the families of a party
was variously provided for in different tribes, but the practical effect
of the several customs relating thereto was the sharing of the supply.
The hungry Indian had but to ask to receive and this no matter how small
the supply, or how dark the future prospect. It was not only his
privilege to ask, it was his right to demand. Undoubtedly what was
originally a right, conferred by kinship connections, ultimately assumed
broader proportions, and finally passed into the exercise of an almost
indiscriminate hospitality. By reason of this custom, the poor hunter
was virtually placed upon equality with the expert one, the lazy with
the industrious, the improvident with the more provident. Stories of
Indian life abound with instances of individual families or parties
being called upon by those less fortunate or provident to share their
supplies.</p>

<p>The effect of such a system, admirable as it was in many particulars,
practically placed a premium upon idleness. Under such communal rights
and privileges a potent spur to industry and thrift is wanting.</p>

<p>There is an obverse side to this problem, which a long and intimate
acquaintance with the Indians in their villages has forced upon the
writer. The communal ownership of food and the great hospitality
practiced by the Indian have had a very much greater influence upon his
character than that indicated in the foregoing
<span class="pagenum">35</span>
<a name="page035" id="page035"> </a>
remarks. The peculiar institutions prevailing in this respect gave to
each tribe or clan a profound interest in the skill, ability and
industry of each member. He was the most valuable person in the
community who supplied it with the most of its necessities. For this
reason the successful hunter or fisherman was always held in high honor,
and the woman, who gathered great store of seeds, fruits, or roots, or
who cultivated a good corn-field, was one who commanded the respect and
received the highest approbation of the people. The simple and rude
ethics of a tribal people are very important to them, the more so
because of their communal institutions; and everywhere throughout the
tribes of the United States it is discovered that their rules of conduct
were deeply implanted in the minds of the people. An organized system of
teaching is always found, as it is the duty of certain officers of the
clan to instruct the young in all the industries necessary to their rude
life, and simple maxims of industry abound among the tribes and are
enforced in diverse and interesting ways. The power of the elder men in
the clan over its young members is always very great, and the training
of the youth is constant and rigid. Besides this, a moral sentiment
exists in favor of primitive virtues which is very effective in molding
character. This may be illustrated in two ways.</p>

<p>Marriage among all Indian tribes is primarily by legal appointment,
as the young woman receives a husband from some other prescribed clan or
clans, and the elders of the clan, with certain exceptions, control
these marriages, and personal choice has little to do with the affair.
When marriages are proposed, the virtues and industry of the candidates,
and more than all, their ability to properly live as married couples and
to supply the clan or tribe with a due amount of subsistence, are
discussed long and earnestly, and the young man or maiden who fails in
this respect may fail in securing an eligible and desirable match. And
these motives are constantly presented to the savage youth.</p>

<p>A simple democracy exists among these people, and they have a variety
of tribal offices to fill. In this way the men of the tribe are graded,
and they pass from grade to grade by a selection practically made by the
people. And this leads to a constant discussion of the virtues and
abilities of all the male members of the clan, from boyhood to old age.
He is most successful in obtaining clan and tribal promotion who is most
useful to the clan and the tribe. In this manner all of the ambitious
are stimulated, and this incentive to industry is very great.</p>

<p>When brought into close contact with the Indian, and into intimate
acquaintance with his language, customs, and religious ideas, there is a
curious tendency observable in students to overlook aboriginal vices and
to exaggerate aboriginal virtues. It seems to
<span class="pagenum">36</span>
<a name="page036" id="page036"> </a>
be forgotten that after all the Indian is a savage, with the
characteristics of a savage, and he is exalted even above the civilized
man. The tendency is exactly the reverse of what it is in the case of
those who view the Indian at a distance and with no precise knowledge of
any of his characteristics. In the estimation of such persons the
Indian’s vices greatly outweigh his virtues; his language is a
gibberish, his methods of war cowardly, his ideas of religion utterly
puerile.</p>

<p>The above tendencies are accentuated in the attempt to estimate the
comparative worth and position of individual tribes. No being is more
patriotic than the Indian. He believes himself to be the result of a
special creation by a partial deity and holds that his is the one
favored race. The name by which the tribes distinguish themselves from
other tribes indicates the further conviction that, as the Indian is
above all created things, so in like manner each particular tribe is
exalted above all others. “Men of men” is the literal translation of one
name; “the only men” of another, and so on through the whole category. A
long residence with any one tribe frequently inoculates the student with
the same patriotic spirit. Bringing to his study of a particular tribe
an inadequate conception of Indian attainments and a low impression of
their moral and intellectual plane, the constant recital of its virtues,
the bravery and prowess of its men in war, their generosity, the chaste
conduct and obedience of its women as contrasted with the opposite
qualities of all other tribes, speedily tends to partisanship. He
discovers many virtues and finds that the moral and intellectual
attainments are higher than he supposed; but these advantages he
imagines to be possessed solely, or at least to an unusual degree, by
the tribe in question. Other tribes are assigned much lower rank in the
scale.</p>

<p>The above is peculiarly true of the student of language. He who
studies only one Indian language and learns its manifold curious
grammatic devices, its wealth of words, its capacity of expression, is
speedily convinced of its superiority to all other Indian tongues, and
not infrequently to all languages by whomsoever spoken.</p>

<p>If like admirable characteristics are asserted for other tongues he
is apt to view them but as derivatives from one original. Thus he is led
to overlook the great truth that the mind of man is everywhere
practically the same, and that the innumerable differences of its
products are indices merely of different stages of growth or are the
results of different conditions of environment. In its development the
human mind is limited by no boundaries of tribe or race.</p>

<p>Again, a long acquaintance with many tribes in their homes leads to
the belief that savage people do not lack industry so much as wisdom.
They are capable of performing, and often do perform, great and
continuous labor. The men and women alike toil from day to day and from
year to year, engaged in those tasks that are
<span class="pagenum">37</span>
<a name="page037" id="page037"> </a>
presented with the recurring seasons. In civilization, hunting and
fishing are often considered sports, but in savagery they are labors,
and call for endurance, patience, and sagacity. And these are exercised
to a reasonable degree among all savage peoples.</p>

<p>It is probable that the real difficulty of purchasing quantities of
food from Indians has, in most cases, not been properly understood.
Unless the alien is present at a time of great abundance, when there is
more on hand or easily obtainable than sufficient to supply the wants of
the people, food can not be bought of the Indians. This arises from the
fact that the tribal tenure is communal, and to get food by purchase
requires a treaty at which all the leading members of the tribe are
present and give consent.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the improvidence of the Indians generally, the
habits of the tribes along the Columbia River may be cited. The Columbia
River has often been pointed to as the probable source of a great part
of the Indian population of this country, because of the enormous supply
of salmon furnished by it and its tributaries. If an abundant and
readily obtained supply of food was all that was necessary to insure a
large population, and if population always increased up to the limit of
food supply, unquestionably the theory of repeated migratory waves of
surplus population from the Columbia Valley would be plausible enough.
It is only necessary, however, to turn to the accounts of the earlier
explorers of this region, Lewis and Clarke, for
example, to refute the idea, so far at least as the Columbia Valley is
concerned, although a study of the many diverse languages spread over
the United States would seem sufficiently to prove that the tribes
speaking them could not have originated at a common center, unless,
indeed, at a period anterior to the formation of organized language.</p>

<p>The Indians inhabiting the Columbia Valley were divided into many
tribes, belonging to several distinct linguistic families. They all were
in the same culture status, however, and differed in habits and arts
only in minor particulars. All of them had recourse to the salmon of the
Columbia for the main part of their subsistence, and all practiced
similar crude methods of curing fish and storing it away for the winter.
Without exception, judging from the accounts of the above mentioned and
of more recent authors, all the tribes suffered periodically more or
less from insufficient food supply, although, with the exercise of due
forethought and economy, even with their rude methods of catching and
curing salmon, enough might here have been cured annually to suffice for
the wants of the Indian population of the entire Northwest for several
years.</p>

<p>In their ascent of the river in spring, before the salmon run, it was
only with great difficulty that Lewis and Clarke were able to provide
themselves by purchase with enough food to keep themselves from
starving. Several parties of Indians from the vicinity of the
<span class="pagenum">38</span>
<a name="page038" id="page038"> </a>
Dalles, the best fishing station on the river, were met on their way
down in quest of food, their supply of dried salmon having been entirely
exhausted.</p>

<p>Nor is there anything in the accounts of any of the early visitors to
the Columbia Valley to authorize the belief that the population there
was a very large one. As was the case with all fish-stocked streams, the
Columbia was resorted to in the fishing season by many tribes living at
considerable distance from it; but there is no evidence tending to show
that the settled population of its banks or of any part of its drainage
basin was or ever had been by any means excessive.</p>

<p>The Dalles, as stated above, was the best fishing station on the
river, and the settled population there may be taken as a fair index of
that of other favorable locations. The Dalles was visited by Ross in
July, 1811, and the following is his statement in regard to the
population:</p>

<blockquote>
The main camp of the Indians is situated at the head of the narrows, and
may contain, during the salmon season, 3,000 souls, or more; but the
constant inhabitants of the place do not exceed 100 persons, and are
called Wy-am-pams; the rest are all foreigners from different tribes
throughout the country, who resort hither, not for the purpose of
catching salmon, but chiefly for gambling and speculation.<a class="tag" name="tag2" id="tag2" href="#note2">2</a></blockquote>

<p>And as it was on the Columbia with its enormous supply of fish, so
was it elsewhere in the United States.</p>

<p>Even the practice of agriculture, with its result of providing a more
certain and bountiful food supply, seems not to have had the effect of
materially augmenting the Indian population. At all events, it is in
California and Oregon, a region where agriculture was scarcely practiced
at all, that the most dense aboriginal population lived. There is no
reason to believe that there ever existed within the limits of the
region included in the map, with the possible exception of certain areas
in California, a population equal to the natural food supply. On the
contrary, there is every reason for believing that the population at the
time of the discovery might have been many times more than what it
actually was had a wise economy been practised.</p>

<p>The effect of wars in decimating the people has often been greatly
exaggerated. Since the advent of the white man on the continent, wars
have prevailed to a degree far beyond that existing at an earlier time.
From the contest which necessarily arose between the native tribes and
invading nations many wars resulted, and their history is well known.
Again, tribes driven from their ancestral homes often retreated to lands
previously occupied by other tribes, and intertribal wars resulted
therefrom. The acquisition of firearms and horses, through the agency of
white men, also had its influence, and when a commercial value was given
to furs and skins, the Indian abandoned
<span class="pagenum">39</span>
<a name="page039" id="page039"> </a>
agriculture to pursue hunting and traffic, and sought new fields for
such enterprises, and many new contests arose from this cause.
Altogether the character of the Indian since the discovery of Columbus
has been greatly changed, and he has become far more warlike and
predatory. Prior to that time, and far away in the wilderness beyond
such influence since that time, Indian tribes seem to have lived
together in comparative peace and to have settled their difficulties by
treaty methods. A few of the tribes had distinct organizations for
purposes of war; all recognized it to a greater or less extent in their
tribal organization; but from such study as has been given the subject,
and from the many facts collected from time to time relating to the
intercourse existing between tribes, it appears that the Indians lived
in comparative peace. Their accumulations were not so great as to be
tempting, and their modes of warfare were not excessively destructive.
Armed with clubs and spears and bows and arrows, war could be prosecuted
only by hand-to-hand conflict, and depended largely upon individual
prowess, while battle for plunder, tribute, and conquest was almost
unknown. Such intertribal wars as occurred originated from other causes,
such as infraction of rights relating to hunting grounds and fisheries,
and still oftener prejudices growing out of their superstitions.</p>

<p>That which kept the Indian population down sprang from another
source, which has sometimes been neglected. The Indians had no
reasonable or efficacious system of medicine. They believed that
diseases were caused by unseen evil beings and by witchcraft, and every
cough, every toothache, every headache, every chill, every fever, every
boil, and every wound, in fact, all their ailments, were attributed to
such cause. Their so-called medicine practice was a horrible system of
sorcery, and to such superstition human life was sacrificed on an
enormous scale. The sufferers were given over to priest doctors to be
tormented, bedeviled, and destroyed; and a universal and profound belief
in witchcraft made them suspicious, and led to the killing of all
suspected and obnoxious people, and engendered blood feuds on a gigantic
scale. It may be safely said that while famine, pestilence, disease, and
war may have killed many, superstition killed more; in fact, a natural
death in a savage tent is a comparatively rare phenomenon; but death by
sorcery, medicine, and blood feud arising from a belief in witchcraft is
exceedingly common.</p>

<p>Scanty as was the population compared with the vast area teeming with
natural products capable of supporting human life, it may be safely said
that at the time of the discovery, and long prior thereto, practically
the whole of the area included in the present map was claimed and to
some extent occupied by Indian tribes; but the possession of land by the
Indian by no means implies occupancy in the modern or civilized sense of
the term. In the latter sense occupation means to a great extent
individual control and
<span class="pagenum">40</span>
<a name="page040" id="page040"> </a>
ownership. Very different was it with the Indians. Individual ownership
of land was, as a rule, a thing entirely foreign to the Indian mind, and
quite unknown in the culture stage to which he belonged. All land, of
whatever character or however utilized, was held in common by the tribe,
or in a few instances by the clan. Apparently an exception to this broad
statement is to be made in the case of the Haida of the northwest coast,
who have been studied by Dawson. According to him<a class="tag" name="tag3"
href="#note3">3</a> the land is divided among the different
families and is held as strictly personal property, with hereditary
rights or possessions descending from one generation to another. “The
lands may be bartered or given away. The larger salmon streams are,
however, often the property jointly of a number of families.” The
tendency in this case is toward personal right in land.</p>


<h5><a name="page040b" id="page040b">TRIBAL LAND.</a></h5>

<p>For convenience of discussion, Indian tribal land may be divided into
three classes: First, the land occupied by the villages; second, the
land actually employed in agriculture; third, the land claimed by the
tribe but not occupied, except as a hunting ground.</p>

<p><a name="page040c" id="page040c"><i>Village sites.</i>&mdash;</a>The
amount of land taken up as village
sites varied considerably in different parts of the country. It varied
also in the same tribe at different times. As a rule, the North American
Indians lived in communal houses of sufficient size to accommodate
several families. In such cases the village consisted of a few large
structures closely grouped together, so that it covered very little
ground. When territory was occupied by warlike tribes, the construction
of rude palisades around the villages and the necessities of defense
generally tended to compel the grouping of houses, and the permanent
village sites of even the more populous tribes covered only a very small
area. In the case of confederated tribes and in the time of peace the
tendency was for one or more families to establish more or less
permanent settlements away from the main village, where a livelihood was
more readily obtainable. Hence, in territory which had enjoyed a
considerable interval of peace the settlements were in the nature of
small agricultural communities, established at short distances from each
other and extending in the aggregate over a considerable extent of
country. In the case of populous tribes the villages were probably of
the character of the Choctaw towns described by Adair.<a class="tag" name="tag4"
href="#note4">4</a> “The barrier towns, which are next
to the Muskohge and Chikkasah countries, are compactly settled for
social defense, according to the general method of other savage nations;
but the rest, both in the center and toward the Mississippi, are only
scattered plantations, as best suits a separate easy
<span class="pagenum">41</span>
<a name="page041" id="page041"> </a>
way of living. A stranger might be in the middle of one of their
populous, extensive towns without seeing half a dozen houses in the
direct course of his path.” More closely grouped settlements are
described by Wayne in American State Papers, 1793, in his account of an
expedition down the Maumee Valley, where he states that “The margins of
the Miamis of the Lake and the Au Glaize appear like one continuous
village for a number of miles, nor have I ever beheld such immense
fields of corn in any part of America from Canada to Florida.” Such a
chain of villages as this was probably highly exceptional; but even
under such circumstances the village sites proper formed but a very
small part of the total area occupied.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations it will be seen that the amount of
land occupied as village sites under any circumstances was
inconsiderable.</p>

<p><a name="page041b" id="page041b"><i>Agricultural land.</i>&mdash;</a>It
is practically impossible to make
an accurate estimate of the relative amount of land devoted to
agricultural purposes by any one tribe or by any family of tribes. None
of the factors which enter into the problem are known to us with
sufficient accuracy to enable reliable estimates to be made of the
amount of land tilled or of the products derived from the tillage; and
only in few cases have we trustworthy estimates of the population of the
tribe or tribes practicing agriculture. Only a rough approximation of
the truth can be reached from the scanty data available and from a
general knowledge of Indian methods of subsistence.</p>

<p>The practice of agriculture was chiefly limited to the region south
of the St. Lawrence and east of the Mississippi. In this region it was
far more general and its results were far more important than is
commonly supposed. To the west of the Mississippi only comparatively
small areas were occupied by agricultural tribes and these lay chiefly
in New Mexico and Arizona and along the Arkansas, Platte, and Missouri
Rivers. The rest of that region was tenanted by non-agricultural
tribes&mdash;unless indeed the slight attention paid to the cultivation
of tobacco by a few of the west coast tribes, notably the Haida, may be
considered agriculture. Within the first mentioned area most of the
tribes, perhaps all, practiced agriculture to a greater or less extent,
though unquestionably the degree of reliance placed upon it as a means
of support differed much with different tribes and localities.</p>

<p>Among many tribes agriculture was relied upon to supply an
important&mdash;and perhaps in the case of a few tribes, the most
important&mdash;part of the food supply. The accounts of some of the
early explorers in the southern United States, where probably
agriculture was more systematized than elsewhere, mention corn fields of
great extent, and later knowledge of some northern tribes, as the
Iroquois and some of the Ohio Valley tribes, shows that they also raised
corn in great quantities.
<span class="pagenum">42</span>
<a name="page042" id="page042"> </a>
The practice of agriculture to a point where it shall prove the main and
constant supply of a people, however, implies a degree of sedentariness
to which our Indians as a rule had not attained and an amount of steady
labor without immediate return which was peculiarly irksome to them.
Moreover, the imperfect methods pursued in clearing, planting, and
cultivating sufficiently prove that the Indians, though agriculturists,
were in the early stages of development as such&mdash;a fact also
attested by the imperfect and one-sided division of labor between the
sexes, the men as a rule taking but small share of the burdensome tasks
of clearing land, planting, and harvesting.</p>

<p>It is certain that by no tribe of the United States was agriculture
pursued to such an extent as to free its members from the practice of
the hunter’s or fisher’s art. Admitting the most that can be claimed for
the Indian as an agriculturist, it may be stated that, whether because
of the small population or because of the crude manner in which his
operations were carried on, the amount of land devoted to agriculture
within the area in question was infinitesimally small as compared with
the total. Upon a map colored to show only the village sites and
agricultural land, the colors would appear in small spots, while by far
the greater part of the map would remain uncolored.</p>

<p><a name="page042b" id="page042b"><i>Hunting claims.</i>&mdash;</a>The
great body of the land within the
area mapped which was occupied by agricultural tribes, and all the land
outside it, was held as a common hunting ground, and the tribal claim to
territory, independent of village sites and corn fields, amounted
practically to little else than hunting claims. The community of
possession in the tribe to the hunting ground was established and
practically enforced by hunting laws, which dealt with the divisions of
game among the village, or among the families of the hunters actually
taking part in any particular hunt. As a rule, such natural landmarks as
rivers, lakes, hills, and mountain chains served to mark with sufficient
accuracy the territorial tribal limits. In California, and among the
Haida and perhaps other tribes of the northwest coast, the value of
certain hunting and fishing claims led to their definition by artificial
boundaries, as by sticks or stones.<a class="tag" name="tag5" id="tag5" href="#note5">5</a></p>

<p>Such precautions imply a large population, and in such regions as
California the killing of game upon the land of adjoining tribes was
rigidly prohibited and sternly punished.</p>

<p>As stated above, every part of the vast area included in the present
map is to be regarded as belonging, according to Indian ideas of land
title, to one or another of the Indian tribes. To determine the several
tribal possessions and to indicate the proper boundary lines between
individual tribes and linguistic families is a work of great
<span class="pagenum">43</span>
<a name="page043" id="page043"> </a>
difficulty. This is due more to the imperfection and scantiness of
available data concerning tribal claims than to the absence of claimants
or to any ambiguity in the minds of the Indians as to the boundaries of
their several possessions.</p>

<p>Not only is precise data wanting respecting the limits of land
actually held or claimed by many tribes, but there are other tribes,
which disappeared early in the history of our country, the boundaries to
whose habitat is to be determined only in the most general way.
Concerning some of these, our information is so vague that the very
linguistic family they belonged to is in doubt. In the case of probably
no one family are the data sufficient in amount and accuracy to
determine positively the exact areas definitely claimed or actually held
by the tribes. Even in respect of the territory of many of the tribes of
the eastern United States, much of whose land was ceded by actual treaty
with the Government, doubt exists. The fixation of the boundary points,
when these are specifically mentioned in the treaty, as was the rule, is
often extremely difficult, owing to the frequent changes of geographic
names and the consequent disagreement of present with ancient maps.
Moreover, when the Indian’s claim to his land had been admitted by
Government, and the latter sought to acquire a title through voluntary
cession by actual purchase, land assumed a value to the Indian never
attaching to it before.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, either under plea of immemorial occupancy
or of possession by right of conquest, the land was often claimed, and
the claims urged with more or less plausibility by several tribes,
sometimes of the same linguistic family, sometimes of different
families.</p>

<p>It was often found by the Government to be utterly impracticable to
decide between conflicting claims, and not infrequently the only way out
of the difficulty lay in admitting the claim of both parties, and in
paying for the land twice or thrice. It was customary for a number of
different tribes to take part in such treaties, and not infrequently
several linguistic families were represented. It was the rule for each
tribe, through its representatives, to cede its share of a certain
territory, the natural boundaries of which as a whole are usually
recorded with sufficient accuracy. The main purpose of the Government in
treaty-making being to obtain possession of the land, comparatively
little attention was bestowed to defining the exact areas occupied by
the several tribes taking part in a treaty, except in so far as the
matter was pressed upon attention by disputing claimants. Hence the
territory claimed by each tribe taking part in the treaty is rarely
described, and occasionally not all the tribes interested in the
proposed cession are even mentioned categorically. The latter statement
applies more particularly to the territory west of the Mississippi, the
data for determining ownership
<span class="pagenum">44</span>
<a name="page044" id="page044"> </a>
to which is much less precise, and the doubt and confusion respecting
tribal boundary lines correspondingly greater than in the country east
of that river. Under the above circumstances, it will be readily
understood that to determine tribal boundaries within accurately drawn
lines is in the vast majority of cases quite impossible.</p>

<p>Imperfect and defective as the terms of the treaties frequently are
as regards the definition of tribal boundaries, they are by far the most
accurate and important of the means at our command for fixing boundary
lines upon the present map. By their aid the territorial possessions of
a considerable number of tribes have been determined with desirable
precision, and such areas definitely established have served as checks
upon the boundaries of other tribes, concerning the location and extent
of whose possessions little is known.</p>

<p>For establishing the boundaries of such tribes as are not mentioned
in treaties, and of those whose territorial possessions are not given
with sufficient minuteness, early historical accounts are all important.
Such accounts, of course, rarely indicate the territorial possessions of
the tribes with great precision. In many cases, however, the sites of
villages are accurately given. In others the source of information
concerning a tribe is contained in a general statement of the occupancy
of certain valleys or mountain ranges or areas at the heads of certain
rivers, no limiting lines whatever being assigned. In others, still, the
notice of a tribe is limited to a brief mention of the presence in a
certain locality of hunting or war parties.</p>

<p>Data of this loose character would of course be worthless in an
attempt to fix boundary lines in accordance with the ideas of the modern
surveyor. The relative positions of the families and the relative size
of the areas occupied by them, however, and not their exact boundaries,
are the chief concern in a linguistic map, and for the purpose of
establishing these, and, in a rough way, the boundaries of the territory
held by the tribes composing them, these data are very important, and
when compared with one another and corrected by more definite data, when
such are at hand, they have usually been found to be sufficient for the
purpose.</p>


<h5><a name="page044b" id="page044b">SUMMARY OF DEDUCTIONS.</a></h5>

<p>In conclusion, the more important deductions derivable from the data
upon which the linguistic map is based, or that are suggested by it, may
be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>First, the North American Indian tribes, instead of speaking related
dialects, originating in a single parent language, in reality speak many
languages belonging to distinct families, which have no apparent unity
of origin.</p>

<p>Second, the Indian population of North America was greatly
exaggerated by early writers, and instead of being large was in reality
small as compared with the vast territory occupied and the
<span class="pagenum">45</span>
<a name="page045" id="page045"> </a>
abundant food supply; and furthermore, the population had nowhere
augmented sufficiently, except possibly in California, to press upon the
food supply.</p>

<p>Third, although representing a small population, the numerous tribes
had overspread North America and had possessed themselves of all the
territory, which, in the case of a great majority of tribes, was owned
in common by the tribe.</p>

<p>Fourth, prior to the advent of the European, the tribes were probably
nearly in a state of equilibrium, and were in the main sedentary, and
those tribes which can be said with propriety to have been nomadic
became so only after the advent of the European, and largely as the
direct result of the acquisition of the horse and the introduction of
firearms.</p>

<p>Fifth, while agriculture was general among the tribes of the eastern
United States, and while it was spreading among western tribes, its
products were nowhere sufficient wholly to emancipate the Indian from
the hunter state.</p>


<h4><a name="page045b" id="page045b">LINGUISTIC FAMILIES.</a></h4>

<p>Within the area covered by the map there are recognized fifty-eight
distinct linguistic families.</p>

<p>These are enumerated in alphabetical order and each is accompanied by
a table of the synonyms of the family name, together with a brief
statement of the geographical area occupied by each family, so far as it
is known. A list of the principal tribes of each family also is
given.</p>

which according to the collector, Dr. Sibley, “differs from all others,
and is so difficult to speak or understand that no nation can speak ten
words of&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>It was from an examination of Sibley’s vocabulary that Gallatin
reached the conclusion of the distinctness of this language from any
other known, an opinion accepted by most later authorities. A recent
comparison of this vocabulary by Mr. Gatschet, with several Caddoan
dialects, has led to the discovery that a considerable percentage of the
Adái words have a more or less remote affinity with Caddoan, and he
regards it as a Caddoan dialect. The amount of material, however,
necessary to establish its relationship to Caddoan is not at present
forthcoming, and it may be doubted if it ever will be, as recent inquiry
has failed to reveal the existence of a single member of the tribe, or
of any individual of the tribes once surrounding the Adái who remembers
a word of the language.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet found that some of the older Caddo in the Indian
Territory remembered the Adái as one of the tribes formerly belonging to
the Caddo Confederacy. More than this he was unable to learn from
them.</p>

<p>Owing to their small numbers, their remoteness from lines of travel,
and their unwarlike character the Adái have cut but a small figure in
history, and accordingly the known facts regarding them are very meager.
The first historical mention of them appears to be by Cabeça de Vaca,
who in his “Naufragios,” referring to his stay in Texas, about 1530,
calls them Atayos. Mention is also made of them by several of the early
French explorers of the Mississippi, as d’Iberville and Joutel.</p>

<p>The Mission of Adayes, so called from its proximity to the home of
the tribe, was established in 1715. In 1792 there was a partial
emigration of the Adái to the number of fourteen families to a site
south of San Antonio de Bejar, southwest Texas, where apparently they
amalgamated with the surrounding Indian population and were lost sight
of. (From documents preserved at the City Hall, San Antonio, and
examined by Mr. Gatschet in December, 1886.) The Adái who were left in
their old homes numbered one hundred in 1802, according to Baudry de
Lozieres. According to Sibley, in 1809 there were only “twenty men of
them remaining, but more women.” In 1820 Morse mentions only thirty
survivors.</p>

<h6><a name="page047b" id="page047b">ALGONQUIAN AREA.</a></h6>

<p>The area formerly occupied by the Algonquian family was more
extensive than that of any other linguistic stock in North America,
their territory reaching from Labrador to the Rocky Mountains, and from
Churchill River of Hudson Bay as far south at least as Pamlico Sound of
North Carolina. In the eastern part of this territory was an area
occupied by Iroquoian tribes, surrounded on almost all sides by their
Algonquian neighbors. On the south the Algonquian tribes were bordered
by those of Iroquoian and Siouan (Catawba) stock, on the southwest and
west by the Muskhogean and Siouan tribes, and on the northwest by the
Kitunahan and the great Athapascan families, while along the coast of
Labrador and the eastern shore of Hudson Bay they came in contact with
the Eskimo, who were gradually retreating before them to the north. In
Newfoundland they encountered the Beothukan family, consisting of but a
single tribe. A portion of the Shawnee at some early period had
separated from the main body of the tribe in central Tennessee and
pushed their way down to the Savannah River in South Carolina, where,
known as Savannahs, they carried on destructive wars with the
surrounding tribes until about the beginning of the eighteenth century
they were finally driven out and joined the Delaware in the north. Soon
afterwards the rest of the tribe was expelled by the Cherokee and
Chicasa, who thenceforward claimed all the country stretching north to
the Ohio River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">48</span>
<a name="page048" id="page048"> </a>
The Cheyenne and Arapaho, two allied tribes of this stock, had become
separated from their kindred on the north and had forced their way
through hostile tribes across the Missouri to the Black Hills country of
South Dakota, and more recently into Wyoming and Colorado, thus forming
the advance guard of the Algonquian stock in that direction, having the
Siouan tribes behind them and those of the Shoshonean family in
front.</p>

present number of the Algonquian stock
is about 95,600, of whom about 60,000 are in Canada and the remainder in
the United States. Below is given the population of the tribes
officially recognized, compiled chiefly from the United States Indian
Commissioner’s report for 1889 and the Canadian Indian report for 1888.
It is impossible to give exact figures, owing to the fact that in many
instances two or more tribes are enumerated together, while many
individuals are living with other tribes or amongst the whites:</p>

<p>Derivation: From the lake of the same name; signifying, according to
Lacombe, “place of hay and reeds.”</p>

<p>As defined by Gallatin, the area occupied by this great family is
included in a line drawn from the mouth of the Churchill or Missinippi
River to its source; thence along the ridge which separates the north
branch of the Saskatchewan from those of the Athapascas to the Rocky
Mountains; and thence northwardly till within a hundred miles of the
Pacific Ocean, in latitude 52°&nbsp;30'.</p>

<p>The only tribe within the above area excepted by Gallatin as of
probably a different stock was the Quarrelers or Loucheux, living at the
mouth of Mackenzie River. This tribe, however, has since been
ascertained to be Athapascan.</p>

<p>The Athapascan family thus occupied almost the whole of British
Columbia and of Alaska, and was, with the exception of the Eskimo, by
whom they were cut off on nearly all sides from the ocean, the most
northern family in North America.</p>

<p>Since Gallatin’s time the history of this family has been further
elucidated by the discovery on the part of Hale and Turner that isolated
branches of the stock have become established in Oregon, California, and
along the southern border of the United States.</p>

<a name="page052b" id="page052b"> </a>
<p>The boundaries of the Athapascan family, as now understood, are best
given under three primary groups&mdash;Northern, Pacific, and
Southern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">53</span>
<a name="page053" id="page053"> </a>
<i>Northern group</i>.&mdash;This includes all the Athapascan tribes of
British North America and Alaska. In the former region the Athapascans
occupy most of the western interior, being bounded on the north by the
Arctic Eskimo, who inhabit a narrow strip of coast; on the east by the
Eskimo of Hudson’s Bay as far south as Churchill River, south of which
river the country is occupied by Algonquian tribes. On the south the
Athapascan tribes extended to the main ridge between the Athapasca and
Saskatchewan Rivers, where they met Algonquian tribes; west of this area
they were bounded on the south by Salishan tribes, the limits of whose
territory on Fraser River and its tributaries appear on Tolmie and
Dawson’s map of 1884. On the west, in British Columbia, the Athapascan
tribes nowhere reach the coast, being cut off by the Wakashan, Salishan,
and Chimmesyan families.</p>

<p>The interior of Alaska is chiefly occupied by tribes of this family.
Eskimo tribes have encroached somewhat upon the interior along the
Yukon, Kuskokwim, Kowak, and Noatak Rivers, reaching on the Yukon to
somewhat below Shageluk Island,<a class="tag" name="tag7" id="tag7" href="#note7">7</a> and on the Kuskokwim nearly or quite to Kolmakoff
Redoubt.<a class="tag" name="tag8" id="tag8" href="#note8">8</a> Upon the
two latter they reach quite to their heads.<a class="tag" name="tag9"
href="#note9">9</a> A few Kutchin tribes are (or have been)
north of the Porcupine and Yukon Rivers, but until recently it has not
been known that they extended north beyond the Yukon and Romanzoff
Mountains. Explorations of Lieutenant Stoney, in 1885, establish the
fact that the region to the north of those mountains is occupied by
Athapascan tribes, and the map is colored accordingly. Only in two
places in Alaska do the Athapascan tribes reach the coast&mdash;the
K’naia-khotana, on Cook’s Inlet, and the Ahtena, of Copper River.</p>

<p><a name="page053b" id="page053b"><i>Pacific group.</i>&mdash;</a>Unlike
the tribes of the Northern group,
most of those of the Pacific group have removed from their priscan
habitats since the advent of the white race. The Pacific group embraces
the following: Kwalhioqua, formerly on Willopah River, Washington, near
the Lower Chinook;<a class="tag" name="tag10" id="tag10" href="#note10">10</a> Owilapsh, formerly between Shoalwater Bay and the heads
of the Chehalis River, Washington, the territory of these two tribes
being practically continuous; Tlatscanai, formerly on a small stream on
the northwest side of Wapatoo Island.<a class="tag" name="tag11"
href="#note11">11</a> Gibbs was informed by an old Indian that this
tribe “formerly owned the prairies on the Tsihalis at the mouth of the
Skukumchuck, but, on the failure of game, left the country, crossed the
Columbia River, and occupied the mountains to the
<span class="pagenum">54</span>
<a name="page054" id="page054"> </a>
south”&mdash;a statement of too uncertain character to be depended upon;
the Athapascan tribes now on the Grande Ronde and Siletz Reservations,
Oregon,<a class="tag" name="tag12" id="tag12" href="#note12">12</a> whose
villages on and near the coast extended from Coquille River southward to
the California line, including, among others, the Upper Coquille, Sixes,
Euchre, Creek, Joshua, Tutu tûnnĕ, and other “Rogue River” or
“Tou-touten bands,” Chasta Costa, Galice Creek, Naltunne tûnnĕ and
Chetco villages;<a class="tag" name="tag13" id="tag13" href="#note13">13</a>
the Athapascan villages formerly on Smith River and tributaries,
California;<a class="tag" name="tag14" id="tag14" href="#note14">14</a> those
villages extending southward from Smith River along the California coast
to the mouth of Klamath River;<a class="tag" name="tag15" id="tag15" href="#note15">15</a> the Hupâ villages or “clans” formerly on Lower Trinity
River, California;<a class="tag" name="tag16" id="tag16" href="#note16">16</a> the Kenesti or Wailakki (2), located as follows: “They
live along the western slope of the Shasta Mountains, from North Eel
River, above Round Valley, to Hay Fork; along Eel and Mad Rivers,
extending down the latter about to Low Gap; also on Dobbins and Larrabie
Creeks;”<a class="tag" name="tag17" id="tag17" href="#note17">17</a> and
Saiaz, who “formerly occupied the tongue of land jutting down between
Eel River and Van Dusen’s Fork.”<a class="tag" name="tag18" id="tag18" href="#note18">18</a></p>

<p><a name="page054b" id="page054b"><i>Southern group.</i>&mdash;</a>Includes
the Navajo, Apache, and Lipan.
Engineer José Cortez, one of the earliest authorities on these tribes,
writing in 1799, defines the boundaries of the Lipan and Apache as
extending north and south from 29° N. to 36° N., and east and west from
99° W. to 114° W.; in other words from central Texas nearly to the
Colorado River in Arizona, where they met tribes of the Yuman stock. The
Lipan occupied the eastern part of the above territory, extending in
Texas from the Comanche country (about Red River) south to the Rio
Grande.<a class="tag" name="tag19" id="tag19" href="#note19">19</a> More
recently both Lipan and Apache have gradually moved southward into
Mexico where they extend as far as Durango.<a class="tag" name="tag20"
href="#note20">20</a></p>

<p>The Navajo, since first known to history, have occupied the country
on and south of the San Juan River in northern New Mexico and Arizona
and extending into Colorado and Utah. They were surrounded on all sides
by the cognate Apache except upon the north, where they meet Shoshonean
tribes.</p>

<p>Derivation: From a Choctaw word meaning “man-eater.”</p>

<p>Little is known of the tribe, the language of which forms the basis
of the present family. The sole knowledge possessed by Gallatin was
derived from a vocabulary and some scanty information furnished by Dr.
John Sibley, who collected his material in the year 1805. Gallatin
states that the tribe was reduced to 50 men. According to Dr. Sibley the
Attacapa language was spoken also by another tribe, the “Carankouas,”
who lived on the coast of Texas, and who conversed in their own language
besides. In 1885 Mr. Gatschet visited the section formerly inhabited by
the Attacapa and after much search discovered one man and two women at
Lake Charles, Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, and another woman living 10
miles to the south; he also heard of five other women then scattered in
western Texas; these are thought to be the only survivors of the tribe.
Mr. Gatschet collected some two thousand words and a considerable body
of text. His vocabulary differs considerably from the one furnished by
Dr. Sibley and published by Gallatin, and indicates that the language of
the western branch of the tribe was dialectically distinct from that of
their brethren farther to the east.</p>

<p>The above material seems to show that the Attacapa language is
distinct from all others, except possibly the Chitimachan.</p>

<p>= Bethuck, Latham in Trans. Philolog. Soc. Lond., 58, 1856 (stated to be
“Algonkin rather than aught else”). Latham, Opuscula, 327, 1860. Latham,

Gatschet, ibid., 411, July, 1886 (language affirmed to represent a
distinct linguistic family). Gatschet, ibid., 1, Jan-June, 1890.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: Beothuk signifies “Indian” or “red Indian.”</p>

<p>The position of the language spoken by the aborigines of Newfoundland
must be considered to be doubtful.</p>

<p>In 1846 Latham examined the material then accessible, and was led to
the somewhat ambiguous statement that the language “was akin to those of
the ordinary American Indians rather than to the Eskimo; further
investigation showing that, of the ordinary American languages, it was
Algonkin rather than aught else.”</p>

<p>Since then Mr. Gatschet has been able to examine a much larger and
more satisfactory body of material, and although neither in amount nor
quality is the material sufficient to permit final and
<span class="pagenum">58</span>
<a name="page058" id="page058"> </a>
satisfactory deductions, yet so far as it goes it shows that the
language is quite distinct from any of the Algonquian dialects, and in
fact from any other American tongue.</p>


<h6><a name="page058b" id="page058b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>It seems highly probable that the whole of Newfoundland at the time
of its discovery by Cabot in 1497 was inhabited by Beothuk Indians.</p>

<p>In 1534 Cartier met with Indians inhabiting the southeastern part of
the island, who, very likely, were of this people, though the
description is too vague to permit certain identification. A century
later the southern portion of the island appears to have been abandoned
by these Indians, whoever they were, on account of European settlements,
and only the northern and eastern parts of the island were occupied by
them. About the beginning of the eighteenth century western Newfoundland
was colonized by the Micmac from Nova Scotia. As a consequence of the
persistent warfare which followed the advent of the latter and which was
also waged against the Beothuk by the Europeans, especially the French,
the Beothuk rapidly wasted in numbers. Their main territory was soon
confined to the neighborhood of the Exploits River. The tribe was
finally lost sight of about 1827, having become extinct, or possibly the
few survivors having crossed to the Labrador coast and joined the
Nascapi with whom the tribe had always been on friendly terms.</p>

<p>Upon the map only the small portion of the island is given to the
Beothuk which is known definitely to have been occupied by them, viz.,
the neighborhood of the Exploits River, though, as stated above, it
seems probable that the entire island was once in their possession.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: From the Caddo term ka´-ede, signifying “chief”
(Gatschet).</p>

<p>The Pawnee and Caddo, now known to be of the same linguistic family,
were supposed by Gallatin and by many later writers to be distinct, and
accordingly both names appear in the Archæologia Americana as family
designations. Both names are unobjectionable, but as the term Caddo has
priority by a few pages preference is given to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Gallatin states “that the Caddoes formerly lived 300 miles up Red
River but have now moved to a branch of Red River.” He refers to the
Nandakoes, the Inies or Tachies, and the Nabedaches as speaking dialects
of the Caddo language.</p>

<p>Under Pawnee two tribes were included by Gallatin: The Pawnees proper
and the Ricaras. The Pawnee tribes occupied the country on the Platte
River adjoining the Loup Fork. The Ricara towns were on the upper
Missouri in latitude 46° 30'.
<span class="pagenum">60</span>
<a name="page060" id="page060"> </a>
The boundaries of the Caddoan family, as at present understood, can best
be given under three primary groups, Northern, Middle, and Southern.</p>

<p><a name="page060b" id="page060b"><i>Northern group.</i>&mdash;</a>This
comprises the Arikara or Ree, now
confined to a small village (on Fort Berthold Reservation, North
Dakota,) which they share with the Mandan and Hidatsa tribes of the
Siouan family. The Arikara are the remains of ten different tribes of
“Paneas,” who had been driven from their country lower down the Missouri
River (near the Ponka habitat in northern Nebraska) by the Dakota. In
1804 they were in three villages, nearer their present location.<a class="tag" name="tag21"
href="#note21">21</a></p>

<p>According to Omaha tradition, the Arikara were their allies when
these two tribes and several others were east of the Mississippi
River.<a class="tag" name="tag22" id="tag22" href="#note22">22</a> Fort
Berthold Reservation, their present abode, is in the northwest corner of
North Dakota.</p>

<p><a name="page060c" id="page060c"><i>Middle group.</i>&mdash;</a>This
includes the four tribes or villages
of Pawnee, the Grand, Republican, Tapage, and Skidi. Dunbar says: “The
original hunting ground of the Pawnee extended from the Niobrara,” in
Nebraska, “south to the Arkansas, but no definite boundaries can be
fixed.” In modern times their villages have been on the Platte River
west of Columbus, Nebraska. The Omaha and Oto were sometimes southeast
of them near the mouth of the Platte, and the Comanche were northwest of
them on the upper part of one of the branches of the Loup Fork.<a class="tag" name="tag23"
href="#note23">23</a> The Pawnee were removed
to Indian Territory in 1876. The Grand Pawnee and Tapage did not wander
far from their habitat on the Platte. The Republican Pawnee separated
from the Grand about the year 1796, and made a village on a “large
northwardly branch of the Kansas River, to which they have given their
name; afterwards they subdivided, and lived in different parts of the
country on the waters of Kansas River. In 1805 they rejoined the Grand
Pawnee.” The Skidi (Panimaha, or Pawnee Loup), according to Omaha
tradition,<a class="tag" name="tag24" id="tag24" href="#note24">24</a>
formerly dwelt east of the Mississippi River, where they were the allies
of the Arikara, Omaha, Ponka, etc. After their passage of the Missouri
they were conquered by the Grand Pawnee, Tapage, and Republican tribes,
with whom they have remained to this day. De L’Isle<a class="tag" name="tag25"
href="#note25">25</a> gives twelve Panimaha villages on the
Missouri River north of the Pani villages on the Kansas River.</p>

<p><a name="page060d" id="page060d"><i>Southern group.</i>&mdash;</a>This
includes the Caddo, Wichita,
Kichai, and other tribes or villages which were formerly in Texas,
Louisiana, Arkansas, and Indian Territory.</p>

<span class="pagenum">61</span>
<a name="page061" id="page061"> </a>
<p>The Caddo and Kichai have undoubtedly been removed from their priscan
habitats, but the Wichita, judging from the survival of local names
(Washita River, Indian Territory, Wichita Falls, Texas) and the
statement of La Harpe,<a class="tag" name="tag26" id="tag26" href="#note26">26</a> are now in or near one of their early abodes. Dr.
Sibley<a class="tag" name="tag27" id="tag27" href="#note27">27</a> locates
the Caddo habitat 35 miles west of the main branch of Red River, being
120 miles by land from Natchitoches, and they formerly lived 375 miles
higher up. Cornell’s Atlas (1870) places Caddo Lake in the northwest
corner of Louisiana, in Caddo County. It also gives both Washita and
Witchita as the name of a tributary of Red River of Louisiana. This
duplication of names seems to show that the Wichita migrated from
northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas to the Indian
Territory. After comparing the statements of Dr. Sibley (as above)
respecting the habitats of the Anadarko, loni, Nabadache, and Eyish
with those of Schermerhorn respecting the Kädo hadatco,<a class="tag" name="tag28"
href="#note28">28</a> of Le Page Du Pratz (1758)

Wichita, and of Sibley concerning the Kichai, we are led to fix upon the
following as the approximate boundaries of the habitat of the southern
group of the Caddoan family: Beginning on the northwest with that part
of Indian Territory now occupied by the Wichita, Chickasaw, and Kiowa
and Comanche Reservations, and running along the southern border of the
Choctaw Reservation to the Arkansas line; thence due east to the
headwaters of Washita or Witchita River, Polk County, Arkansas; thence
through Arkansas and Louisiana along the western bank of that river to
its mouth; thence southwest through Louisiana striking the Sabine River
near Salem and Belgrade; thence southwest through Texas to Tawakonay
Creek, and along that stream to the Brazos River; thence following that
stream to Palo Pinto, Texas; thence northwest to the mouth of the North
Fork of Red River; and thence to the beginning.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation unknown.</p>

<p>Concerning this language Gibbs, as above cited, states as
follows:</p>

<p>The language of the Chimakum “differs materially from either that of
the Clallams or the Nisqually, and is not understood by any of their
neighbors. In fact, they seem to have maintained it a State secret. To
what family it will ultimately be referred, cannot now be decided.”</p>

<p>Eells also asserts the distinctness of this language from any of its
neighbors. Neither of the above authors assigned the language family
rank, and accordingly Mr. Gatschet, who has made a comparison of
vocabularies and finds the language to be quite distinct from any other,
gives it the above name.</p>

<p>The Chimakum are said to have been formerly one of the largest and
most powerful tribes of Puget Sound. Their warlike habits early tended
to diminish their numbers, and when visited by Gibbs in 1854 they counted
only about seventy individuals. This small remnant occupied some fifteen
small lodges on Port Townsend Bay. According to Gibbs “their territory
seems to have embraced the shore from Port Townsend to Port Ludlow.”<a
class="tag" name="tag31" id="tag31" href="#note31">31</a> In 1884 there were,

<p>The Quile-ute, of whom in 1889 there were 252 living on the Pacific

April, 1882 (stated to be a distinct family).</p>

</div>

<p>According to Powers, this family was represented, so far as known, by
two tribes in California, one the Chi-mál-a-kwe, living on New River, a&nbsp;branch of the Trinity, the other the Chimariko, residing upon the
Trinity itself from Burnt Ranch up to the mouth of North Fork,
California. The two tribes are said to have been as numerous formerly as
the Hupa, by whom they were overcome and nearly exterminated. Upon the
arrival of the Americans only twenty-five of the Chimalakwe were left.
In 1875 Powers collected a Chimariko vocabulary of about two hundred
words from a woman, supposed to be one of the last three women of that
tribe. In 1889 Mr. Curtin, while in Hoopa Valley, found a Chimariko man
seventy or more years old, who is believed to be one of the two living
survivors of the tribe. Mr. Curtin obtained a good vocabulary and much
valuable information relative to the former habitat and history of the
tribe. Although a study of these vocabularies reveals a number of words
having correspondences with the Kulanapan (Pomo) equivalents, yet the
greater number show no affinities with the dialects of the latter
family, or indeed with any other. The family is therefore classed as
distinct.</p>

<p>Derivation: From the Chimsian ts’em, “on;” kcian, “main river:”
“On&nbsp;the main (Skeena) river.”</p>

<p>This name appears in a paper of Latham’s published in 1848. To it is
referred a vocabulary of Tolmie’s. The area where it is spoken is said
by Latham to be 50° 30' and 55° 30'. The name has become established by
long usage, and it is chiefly on this account that it has been given
preference over the Naas of Gallatin of the same year. The latter name
was given by Gallatin to a group of languages now known to be not
related, viz, Hailstla, Haceltzuk Billechola, and Chimeysan. Billechola
belongs under Salishan, a family name of Gallatin’s of 1836.</p>

<p>Were it necessary to take Naas as a family name it would best apply
to Chimsian, it being the name of a dialect and village of Chimsian
Indians, while it has no pertinency whatever to Hailstla and Haceltzuk,
which are closely related and belong to a family quite distinct from the
Chimmesyan. As stated above, however, the term Naas is rejected in favor
of Chimmesyan of the same date.</p>

<p>For the boundaries of this family the linguistic map published by
Tolmie and Dawson, in 1884, is followed.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of the Chinook tribe, upon which the family name was
based, was derived from the mouth of the Columbia. As now understood the
family embraces a number of tribes, speaking allied languages, whose
former homes extended from the mouth of the river for some 200 miles, or
to The Dalles. According to Lewis and Clarke, our best authorities on
the pristine home of this family, most of their villages were on the
banks of the river, chiefly upon the northern bank, though they probably
claimed the land upon either bank for several miles back.
<span class="pagenum">66</span>
<a name="page066" id="page066"> </a>
Their villages also extended on the Pacific coast north nearly to the
northern extreme of Shoalwater Bay, and to the south to about Tillamook
Head, some 20 miles from the mouth of the Columbia.</p>

Chinook Indians,” probably belonging to one of the down-river tribes,
about 6 miles above the mouth of the Columbia. Two of these speak the

</div>


<p>Derivation: From Chumash, the name of the Santa Rosa Islanders.</p>

<p>The several dialects of this family have long been known under the
group or family name, “Santa Barbara,” which seems first to have been
used in a comprehensive sense by Latham in 1856, who included under it
three languages, viz: Santa Barbara, Santa Inez, and San Luis Obispo.
The term has no special pertinence as a family designation, except from
the fact that the Santa Barbara Mission, around which one of the
dialects of the family was spoken, is perhaps more widely known than any
of the others. Nevertheless, as it is the family name first applied to
the group and has, moreover, passed into current use its claim to
recognition would not be questioned were it not a compound name. Under
the rule adopted the latter fact necessitates its rejection. As a
suitable substitute the term Chumashan is here adopted. Chumash is the
name of the Santa Rosa Islanders, who spoke a dialect of this stock, and
is a term widely known among the Indians of this family.</p>

<p>The Indians of this family lived in villages, the villages as a whole
apparently having no political connection, and hence there appears to
have been no appellation in use among them to designate themselves as a
whole people.</p>

<p>Dialects of this language were spoken at the Missions of San
Buenaventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Iñez, Purísima, and San Luis Obispo.
Kindred dialects were spoken also upon the Islands of Santa Rosa and
Santa Cruz, and also, probably, upon such other of the Santa Barbara
Islands as formerly were permanently inhabited.</p>

<p>These dialects collectively form a remarkably homogeneous family, all
of them, with the exception of the San Luis Obispo, being closely
related and containing very many words in common. Vocabularies
representing six dialects of the language are in possession of the
Bureau of Ethnology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">68</span>
<a name="page068" id="page068"> </a>
The inland limits of this family can not be exactly defined, although a
list of more than one hundred villages with their sites, obtained by Mr.
Henshaw in 1884, shows that the tribes were essentially maritime and
were closely confined to the coast.</p>

<p><a name="page068b" id="page068b"><i>Population.</i>&mdash;</a>In
1884 Mr. Henshaw visited the several
counties formerly inhabited by the populous tribes of this family and
discovered that about forty men, women, and children survived. The
adults still speak their old language when conversing with each other,
though on other occasions they use Spanish. The largest settlement is at
San Buenaventura, where perhaps 20 individuals live near the outskirts
of the town.</p>

from Garcia’s Manual, 1760.)</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: From the name of the Mexican State Coahuila.</p>

<p>This family appears to have included numerous tribes in southwestern
Texas and in Mexico. They are chiefly known through the record of the
Rev. Father Bartolomé Garcia (Manual para administrar, etc.), published
in 1760. In the preface to the “Manual” he enumerates the tribes and
sets forth some phonetic and grammatic differences between the
dialects.</p>

<p>On page 63 of his Geografía de las Lenguas de México, 1864, Orozco y
Berra gives a list of the languages of Mexico and includes Coahuilteco,
indicating it as the language of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas.
He does not, however, indicate its extension into Texas. It would thus
seem that he intended the name as a general designation for the language
of all the cognate tribes.</p>

<p>Upon his colored ethnographic map, also, Orozco y Berra designates
the Mexican portion of the area formerly occupied by the tribes of this
family Coahuilteco.<a class="tag" name="tag33" id="tag33" href="#note33">33</a> In his statement that the language and tribes are
extinct this author was mistaken, as a few Indians still survive who
speak one of the dialects of this family, and in 1886 Mr. Gatschet
collected vocabularies of two tribes, the Comecrudo and Cotoname, who
live on the Rio Grande, at Las Prietas, State of Tamaulipas. Of the
Comecrudo some twenty-five still remain, of whom seven speak the
language.</p>

<p>The Cotoname are practically extinct, although Mr. Gatschet obtained
one hundred and twenty-five words from a man said to be of this blood.
Besides the above, Mr. Gatschet obtained information of the existence of
two women of the Pinto or Pakawá tribe who live at La Volsa, near
Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on the Rio Grande, and who are said to speak their
own language.</p>

<p>This name was proposed by Latham with evident hesitation. He says of
it: “How far this will eventually turn out to be a convenient name for
the group (or how far the group itself will be real), is uncertain.”
Under it he places two vocabularies, one from the Upper Sacramento and
the other from Mag Redings in Shasta County. The head of Putos Creek is
given as headquarters for the language. Recent investigations have
served to fully confirm the validity of the family.</p>

Shasta and the territory of the Sastean and Lutuamian families, on the
east by the territory of the Palaihnihan, Yanan, and Pujunan families,
and on the south by the bays of San Pablo and Suisun and the lower
waters of the Sacramento.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary of the territory begins about 5 miles east of
Mount Shasta, crosses Pit River a little east of Squaw Creek, and
reaches to within 10 miles of the eastern bank of the Sacramento at
Redding. From Redding to Chico Creek the boundary is about 10 miles east
of the Sacramento. From Chico downward the Pujunan family encroaches
till at the mouth of Feather River it occupies

the eastern bank of the Sacramento. The western boundary of the Copehan
family begins at the northernmost point of San Pablo Bay, trends to the
northwest in a somewhat irregular line till it reaches John’s Peak, from
which point it follows the Coast Range to the tipper waters of
Cottonwood Creek, whence it deflects to the west, crossing the
headwaters of the Trinity and ending at the southern boundary of the
Sastean family.</p>

<p>Derivation: From the Spanish costano, “coast-men.”</p>

<p>Under this group name Latham included five tribes, given above, which
were under the supervision of the Mission Dolores. He gives a few words
of the Romonan language, comparing it with Tshokoyem which he finds to
differ markedly. He finally expresses the opinion that, notwithstanding
the resemblance of a few words, notably personal pronouns, to Tshokoyem
of the Moquelumnan group, the affinities of the dialects of the Costano
are with the Salinas group, with which, however, he does not unite it
but prefers to keep it by itself. Later, in 1877, Mr. Gatschet,<a class="tag" name="tag34"
href="#note34">34</a> under the family name
Mutsun, united the Costano dialects with the ones classified by Latham
under Moquelumnan. This arrangement was followed by Powell in his
classification of vocabularies.<a class="tag" name="tag35" id="tag35" href="#note35">35</a> More recent comparison of all the published material by
Mr. Curtin, of the Bureau, revealed very decided and apparently radical
differences between the two groups of dialects. In 1888 Mr. H.&nbsp;W.
Henshaw visited the coast to the north and south of San Francisco, and
obtained a considerable body of linguistic material for further
comparison. The result seems fully to justify the separation of the two
groups as distinct families.</p>

<h6>GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</h6>

<p>The territory of the Costanoan family extends from the Golden Gate to
a point near the southern end of Monterey Bay. On the south it is
bounded from Monterey Bay to the mountains by the Esselenian territory.
On the east side of the mountains it extends to the southern end of
Salinas Valley. On the east it is bounded by a somewhat irregular line
running from the southern end of Salinas Valley to Gilroy Hot Springs
and the upper waters of Conestimba Creek, and, northward from the latter
points by the San Joaquin River to its mouth. The northern boundary is
formed by Suisun Bay, Carquinez Straits, San Pablo and San Francisco
Bays, and the Golden Gate.</p>

<p><a name="page071b" id="page071b"><i>Population.</i>&mdash;</a>The
surviving Indians of the once populous
tribes of this family are now scattered over several counties and
probably do not number, all told, over thirty individuals, as was
ascertained by Mr. Henshaw in 1888. Most of these are to be found near
the towns of Santa Cruz and Monterey. Only the older individuals speak
the language.</p>

<p>Derivation: From an Algonkin word eskimantik, “eaters of raw flesh.”</p>


<h6><a name="page072b" id="page072b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The geographic boundaries of this family were set forth by Gallatin
in 1836 with considerable precision, and require comparatively little
revision and correction.</p>

<p>In the linear extent of country occupied, the Eskimauan is the most
remarkable of the North American linguistic families. It extends
coastwise from eastern Greenland to western Alaska and to the extremity
of the Aleutian Islands, a distance of considerably more than 5,000
miles. The winter or permanent villages are usually situated on the
coast and are frequently at considerable distances from one another, the
intervening areas being usually visited in summer for hunting and
fishing purposes. The interior is also visited by the Eskimo for the
purpose of hunting reindeer and other animals, though they rarely
penetrate farther than 50 miles. A narrow strip along the coast,
perhaps 30 miles wide, will probably, on the average, represent Eskimo
occupancy.</p>

<p>Except upon the Aleutian Islands, the dialects spoken over this vast
area are very similar, the unity of dialect thus observable being in
marked contrast to the tendency to change exhibited in other linguistic
families of North America.</p>

<p>How far north the east coast of Greenland is inhabited by Eskimo is
not at present known. In 1823 Capt. Clavering met with two families of
Eskimo north of 74° 30'. Recent explorations (1884-’85) by Capt. Holm,
of the Danish Navy, along the southeast coast reveal the presence of
Eskimo between 65° and 66° north latitude. These Eskimo profess entire
ignorance of any inhabitants north of themselves, which may be taken as
proof that if there are fiords farther up the coast which are inhabited
there has been no intercommunication in recent times at least between
these tribes and those to the south. It seems probable that more or less
isolated colonies of Eskimo do actually exist along the east coast of
Greenland far to the north.</p>

<p>Along the west coast of Greenland, Eskimo occupancy extends to about
74°. This division is separated by a considerable interval of
uninhabited coast from the Etah Eskimo who occupy the coast from Smith
Sound to Cape York, their most northerly village being in
<span class="pagenum">73</span>
<a name="page073" id="page073"> </a>
78° 18'. For our knowledge of these interesting people we are chiefly
indebted to Ross and Bessels.</p>

<p>In Grinnell Land, Gen. Greely found indications of permanent Eskimo
habitations near Fort Conger, lat. 81°&nbsp;44'.</p>

<p>On the coast of Labrador the Eskimo reach as far south as Hamilton
Inlet, about 55° 30'. Not long since they extended to the Straits of
Belle Isle, 50°&nbsp;30'.</p>

<p>On the east coast of Hudson Bay the Eskimo reach at present nearly to
James Bay. According to Dobbs<a class="tag" name="tag36" id="tag36" href="#note36">36</a> in 1744 they extended as far south as east Maine River,
or about 52°. The name Notaway (Eskimo) River at the southern end of the
bay indicates a former Eskimo extension to that point.</p>

<p>According to Boas and Bessels the most northern Eskimo of the middle
group north of Hudson Bay reside on the southern extremity of Ellesmere
Land around Jones Sound. Evidences of former occupation of Prince
Patrick, Melville, and other of the northern Arctic islands are not
lacking, but for some unknown cause, probably a failure of food supply,
the Eskimo have migrated thence and the islands are no longer inhabited.
In the western part of the central region the coast appears to be
uninhabited from the Coppermine River to Cape Bathurst. To the west of
the Mackenzie, Herschel Island marks the limit of permanent occupancy by
the Mackenzie Eskimo, there being no permanent villages between that
island and the settlements at Point Barrow.</p>

<p>The intervening strip of coast is, however, undoubtedly hunted over
more or less in summer. The Point Barrow Eskimo do not penetrate far
into the interior, but farther to the south the Eskimo reach to the
headwaters of the Nunatog and Koyuk Rivers. Only visiting the coast for
trading purposes, they occupy an anomalous position among Eskimo.</p>

<p>Eskimo occupancy of the rest of the Alaska coast is practically
continuous throughout its whole extent as far to the south and east as
the Atna or Copper River, where begin the domains of the Koluschan
family. Only in two places do the Indians of the Athapascan family
intrude upon Eskimo territory, about Cook’s Inlet, and at the mouth of
Copper River.</p>

<p>Owing to the labors of Dall, Petroff, Nelson, Turner, Murdoch, and
others we are now pretty well informed as to the distribution of the
Eskimo in Alaska.</p>

<p>Nothing is said by Gallatin of the Aleutian Islanders and they were
probably not considered by him to be Eskimauan. They are now known to
belong to this family, though the Aleutian dialects are unintelligible
to the Eskimo proper. Their distribution has been entirely changed since
the advent of the Russians and the introduction
<span class="pagenum">74</span>
<a name="page074" id="page074"> </a>
of the fur trade, and at present they occupy only a very small portion
of the islands. Formerly they were much more numerous than at present
and extended throughout the chain.</p>

<p>The Eskimauan family is represented in northeast Asia by the Yuit of
the Chukchi peninsula, who are to be distinguished from the sedentary
Chukchi or the Tuski of authors, the latter being of Asiatic origin.
According to Dall the former are comparatively recent arrivals from the
American continent, and, like their brethren of America, are confined
exclusively to the coast.</p>

nothing is known. Dall compiles the following estimates of the Alaskan
Eskimo from the most reliable figures up to 1885: Of the Northwestern
Innuit 3,100 (?), including the Kopagmiut, Kangmaligmiut, Nuwukmiut,
Nunatogmiut, Kuagmiut, the Inguhklimiut of Little Diomede Island 40 (?),
Shiwokugmiut of St. Lawrence Island 150 (?), the Western Innuit 14,500
(?), the Aleutian Islanders (Unungun) 2,200 (?); total of the Alaskan
Innuit, about 20,000.</p>

<p>The Central or Baffin Land Eskimo are estimated by Boas to number
about 1,100.<a class="tag" name="tag37" id="tag37" href="#note37">37</a></p>

<p>From figures given by Rink, Packard, and others, the total number of
Labrador Eskimo is believed to be about 2,000.</p>

<p>According to Holm (1884-’85) there are about 550 Eskimo on the east
coast of Greenland. On the west coast the mission Eskimo numbered 10,122
in 1886, while the northern Greenland Eskimo, the Arctic Highlanders of
Ross, number about 200.</p>

<p>Thus throughout the Arctic regions generally there is a total of
about 34,000.</p>

Gioloco?, Ruslen, Soledad, Eslen, Carmel, San Antonio, and San Miguel,
cited as including Eslen). Latham, Opuscula, 350, 1860.</p>

</div>

<p>As afterwards mentioned under the Salinan family, the present family
was included by Latham in the heterogeneous group called by him Salinas.
For reasons there given the term Salinan was restricted to the San
Antonio and San Miguel languages, leaving the present family without a
name. It is called Esselenian, from the name of the single tribe
Esselen, of which it is composed.</p>

<p>Its history is a curious and interesting one. Apparently the first
mention of the tribe and language is to be found in the Voyage de la
Pérouse, Paris, 1797, page 288, where Lamanon (1786) states that the
language of the Ecclemachs (Esselen) differs “absolutely from all those
of their neighbors.” He gives a vocabulary of twenty-two words and by
way of comparison a list of the ten numerals of the Achastlians
(Costanoan family). It was a study of the former short vocabulary,
published by Taylor in the California Farmer, October 24, 1862, that
first led to the supposition of the distinctness of this language.</p>

<p>A few years later the Esselen people came under the observation of
Galiano,<a class="tag" name="tag38" id="tag38" href="#note38">38</a> who
mentions the Eslen and Runsien as two distinct nations, and notes a
variety of differences in usages and customs which are of no great
weight. It is of interest to note, however, that this author also
appears to have observed essential differences
<span class="pagenum">76</span>
<a name="page076" id="page076"> </a>
in the languages of the two peoples, concerning which he says: “The same
difference as in usage and custom is observed in the languages of the
two nations, as will be perceived from the following comparison with
which we will conclude this chapter.”</p>

<p>Galiano supplies Esselen and Runsien vocabularies of thirty-one
words, most of which agree with the earlier vocabulary of Lamanon. These
were published by Taylor in the California Farmer under date of April
20, 1860.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1888 Mr. H. W. Henshaw visited the vicinity of
Monterey with the hope of discovering survivors of these Indians. Two
women were found in the Salinas Valley to the south who claimed to be of
Esselen blood, but neither of them was able to recall any of the
language, both having learned in early life to speak the Runsien
language in place of their own. An old woman was found in the Carmelo
Valley near Monterey and an old man living near the town of Cayucos,
who, though of Runsien birth, remembered considerable of the language of
their neighbors with whom they were connected by marriage. From them a
vocabulary of one hundred and ten words and sixty-eight phrases and
short sentences were obtained. These serve to establish the general
correctness of the short lists of words collected so long ago by Lamanon
and Galiano, and they also prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
Esselen language forms a family by itself and has no connection with any
other known.</p>

<p>The tribe or tribes composing this family occupied a narrow strip of
the California coast from Monterey Bay south to the vicinity of the
Santa Lucia Mountain, a distance of about 50 miles.</p>

<p>Derivation: French, adaptation of the Iroquois word hiro, used to
conclude a speech, and koué, an exclamation (Charlevoix). Hale gives as
possible derivations ierokwa, the indeterminate form of the verb to
smoke, signifying “they who smoke;” also the Cayuga form of bear,
iakwai.<a class="tag" name="tag39" id="tag39" href="#note39">39</a> Mr.

the Algonkin words īrīn, true, or real; ako, snake; with the French
termination ois, the word becomes Irinakois.</p>

<p>With reference to this family it is of interest to note that as early
as 1798 Barton<a class="tag" name="tag41" id="tag41" href="#note41">41</a>
compared the Cheroki language with that of the Iroquois and stated his
belief that there was a connection between them. Gallatin, in the
Archæologia Americana, refers to the opinion expressed by Barton, and
although he states that he is inclined to agree with that author, yet he
does not formally refer Cheroki to that family, concluding that
“We&nbsp;have not a sufficient knowledge of the grammar, and generally of
the language of the Five Nations, or of the Wyandots, to decide that
question.”<a class="tag" name="tag42" id="tag42" href="#note42">42</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hale was the first to give formal expression to his belief in the

into possession of the Bureau of Ethnology, and a careful comparison of
them with ample Iroquois material has been made by Mr. Hewitt. The
result is convincing proof of the relationship of the two languages as
affirmed by Barton so long ago.</p>


<h6><a name="page077b" id="page077b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>Unlike most linguistic stocks, the Iroquoian tribes did not occupy a
continuous area, but when first known to Europeans were settled in three
distinct regions, separated from each other by tribes of other lineage.
The northern group was surrounded by tribes of Algonquian stock, while
the more southern groups bordered upon the Catawba and Maskoki.</p>

<p>A tradition of the Iroquois points to the St. Lawrence region as the
early home of the Iroquoian tribes, whence they gradually moved down to
the southwest along the shores of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>When Cartier, in 1534, first explored the bays and inlets of the Gulf
of St. Lawrence he met a Huron-Iroquoian people on the shores of the Bay
of Gaspé, who also visited the northern coast of the gulf. In the
following year when he sailed up the St. Lawrence River he
<span class="pagenum">78</span>
<a name="page078" id="page078"> </a>
found the banks of the river from Quebec to Montreal occupied by an
Iroquoian people. From statements of Champlain and other early explorers
it seems probable that the Wyandot once occupied the country along the
northern shore of Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>The Conestoga, and perhaps some allied tribes, occupied the country
about the Lower Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and have
commonly been regarded as an isolated body, but it seems probable that
their territory was contiguous to that of the Five Nations on the north
before the Delaware began their westward movement.</p>

<p>As the Cherokee were the principal tribe on the borders of the
southern colonies and occupied the leading place in all the treaty
negotiations, they came to be considered as the owners of a large
territory to which they had no real claim. Their first sale, in 1721,
embraced a tract in South Carolina, between the Congaree and the South
Fork of the Edisto,<a class="tag" name="tag44" id="tag44" href="#note44">44</a> but about one-half of this tract, forming the present
Lexington County, belonging to the Congaree.<a class="tag" name="tag45"
href="#note45">45</a> In 1755 they sold a second tract above
the first and extending across South Carolina from the Savannah to the
Catawba (or Wateree),<a class="tag" name="tag46" id="tag46" href="#note46">46</a> but all of this tract east of Broad River belonged to
other tribes. The lower part, between the Congaree and the Wateree, had
been sold 20 years before, and in the upper part the Broad River was
acknowledged as the western Catawba boundary.<a class="tag" name="tag47"
href="#note47">47</a> In 1770 they sold a tract, principally
in Virginia and West Virginia, bounded east by the Great Kanawha,<a
class="tag" name="tag48" id="tag48" href="#note48">48</a> but the Iroquois
claimed by conquest all of this tract northwest of the main ridge of the
Alleghany and Cumberland Mountains, and extending at least to the
Kentucky River,<a class="tag" name="tag49" id="tag49" href="#note49">49</a>
and two years previously they had made a treaty with Sir William Johnson
by which they were recognized as the owners of all between Cumberland
Mountains and the Ohio down to the Tennessee.<a class="tag" name="tag50"
href="#note50">50</a> The Cumberland River basin was the only
part of this tract to which the Cherokee had any real title, having
driven out the former occupants, the Shawnee, about 1721.<a class="tag" name="tag51"
href="#note51">51</a> The Cherokee had no
villages north of the Tennessee (this probably includes the Holston as
its upper part), and at a conference at Albany the Cherokee delegates
presented to the Iroquois the skin of a deer, which they said belonged
to the Iroquois, as the animal had been killed north of the Tennessee.<a
class="tag" name="tag52" id="tag52" href="#note52">52</a> In 1805, 1806, and
1817 they sold several tracts, mainly in
<span class="pagenum">79</span>
<a name="page079" id="page079"> </a>
middle Tennessee, north of the Tennessee River and extending to the
Cumberland River watershed, but this territory was claimed and had been
occupied by the Chickasaw, and at one conference the Cherokee admitted
their claim.<a class="tag" name="tag53" id="tag53" href="#note53">53</a> The
adjacent tract in northern Alabama and Georgia, on the headwaters of the
Coosa, was not permanently occupied by the Cherokee until they began to
move westward, about 1770.</p>

<p>The whole region of West Virginia, Kentucky, and the Cumberland River
region of Tennessee was claimed by the Iroquois and Cherokee, but the
Iroquois never occupied any of it and the Cherokee could not be said to
occupy any beyond the Cumberland Mountains. The Cumberland River was
originally held by the Shawnee, and the rest was occupied, so far as it
was occupied at all, by the Shawnee, Delaware, and occasionally by the
Wyandot and Mingo (Iroquoian), who made regular excursions southward
across the Ohio every year to hunt and to make salt at the licks. Most
of the temporary camps or villages in Kentucky and West Virginia were
built by the Shawnee and Delaware. The Shawnee and Delaware were the
principal barrier to the settlement of Kentucky and West Virginia for a
period of 20 years, while in all that time neither the Cherokee nor the
Iroquois offered any resistance or checked the opposition of the Ohio
tribes.</p>

<p>The Cherokee bounds in Virginia should be extended along the mountain
region as far at least as the James River, as they claim to have lived
at the Peaks of Otter,<a class="tag" name="tag54" id="tag54" href="#note54">54</a> and seem to be identical with the Rickohockan or
Rechahecrian of the early Virginia writers, who lived in the mountains
beyond the Monacan, and in 1656 ravaged the lowland country as far as
the site of Richmond and defeated the English and the Powhatan Indians
in a pitched battle at that place.<a class="tag" name="tag55" id="tag55" href="#note55">55</a></p>

<p>The language of the Tuscarora, formerly of northeastern North
Carolina, connect them directly with the northern Iroquois. The Chowanoc
and Nottoway and other cognate tribes adjoining the Tuscarora may have
been offshoots from that tribe.</p>

Kalapooiah than the Yamkallie is.” The Umpqua language is now placed
under the Athapascan family. Scouler also asserts the intimate
relationship of the Cathlascon tribes to the Kalapooiah family. They are
now classed as Chinookan.</p>

<div class="tribename">

<p>= Karánkawa, Gatschet in Globus, <span class="smallroman">XLIX</span>,
No. 8, 123, 1886 (vocabulary of 25 terms; distinguished as a family
provisionally). Gatschet in Science, 414, April 9, 1887.</p>

</div>

<p>The Karankawa formerly dwelt upon the Texan coast, according to
Sibley, upon an island or peninsula in the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda
Bay). In 1804 this author, upon hearsay evidence, stated their number to
be 500 men.<a class="tag" name="tag56" id="tag56" href="#note56">56</a> In
several places in the paper cited it is explicitly stated that the
Karankawa spoke the Attakapa language; the Attakapa was a coast tribe
living to the east of them. In 1884 Mr. Gatschet found a Tonkawe at Fort
Griffin, Texas, who claimed to have formerly lived among the Karankawa.
From him a vocabulary of twenty-five terms was obtained, which was all
of the language he remembered.</p>

<p>The vocabulary is unsatisfactory, not only because of its meagerness,
but because most of the terms are unimportant for comparison.
Nevertheless, such as it is, it represents all of the language that is
extant. Judged by this vocabulary the language seems to be distinct not
only from the Attakapa but from all others. Unsatisfactory as the
linguistic evidence is, it appears to be safer to class the language
provisionally as a distinct family upon the strength of it than to
accept Sibley’s statement of its identity with Attakapa, especially as
we know nothing of the extent of his information or whether indeed his
statement was based upon a personal knowledge of the language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">83</span>
<a name="page083" id="page083"> </a>
A careful search has been made with the hope of finding a few survivors
of this family, but thus far not a single descendant of the tribe has
been discovered and it is probable that not one is now living.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: From the Kiowa word Kó-i, plural Kó-igu, meaning “Káyowe
man.” The Comanche term káyowe means “rat.”</p>

<p>The author who first formally separated this family appears to have
been Turner. Gallatin mentions the tribe and remarks that owing to the
loss of Dr. Say’s vocabularies “we&nbsp;only know that both the Kiowas and
Kaskaias languages were harsh, guttural, and extremely difficult.”<a
class="tag" name="tag60" id="tag60" href="#note60">60</a> Turner, upon the
strength of a vocabulary furnished by Lieut. Whipple, dissents from the
opinion expressed by Pike and others to the effect that the language is
of the same stock as the Comanche, and, while admitting that its
relationship to Camanche is greater than to any other family, thinks
that the likeness is merely the result of long intercommunication. His
opinion that it is entirely distinct from any other language has been
indorsed by Buschmann and other authorities. The family is represented
by the Kiowa tribe.</p>

<p>So intimately associated with the Comanches have the Kiowa been since
known to history that it is not easy to determine their pristine home.
By the Medicine Creek treaty of October 18, 1867, they and the Comanches
were assigned their present reservation in the Indian Territory, both
resigning all claims to other territory, especially their claims and
rights in and to the country north of the Cimarron River and west of the
eastern boundary of New Mexico.</p>

<p>The terms of the cession might be taken to indicate a joint ownership
of territory, but it is more likely that the Kiowa territory adjoined
the Comanche on the northwest. In fact Pope<a class="tag" name="tag61"
href="#note61">61</a> definitely locates the Kiowa in the
valley of the Upper Arkansas, and of its tributary, the Purgatory (Las
Animas) River. This is in substantial accord with the statements of
other writers of about the same period. Schermerhorn (1812) places the
Kiowa on the heads of the Arkansas and Platte. Earlier still they appear
upon the headwaters of the Platte, which is the region assigned them
upon the map.<a class="tag" name="tag62" id="tag62" href="#note62">62</a>
This region was occupied later by the Cheyenne and Arapaho of Algonquian
stock.</p>

<p><a name="page084b" id="page084b"><i>Population.</i>&mdash;</a>According
to the United States census for
1890 there are 1,140 Kiowa on the Kiowa, Comanche, and Wichita
Reservation, Indian Territory.</p>

<p>This family was based upon a tribe variously termed Kitunaha,
Kutenay, Cootenai, or Flatbow, living on the Kootenay River, a branch of
the Columbia in Oregon.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet thinks it is probable that there are two dialects of the
language spoken respectively in the extreme northern and southern
portions of the territory occupied, but the vocabularies at hand are not
sufficient to definitely settle the question.</p>

<p>The area occupied by the Kitunahan tribes is inclosed between the
northern fork of the Columbia River, extending on the south along the
Cootenay River. By far the greater part of the territory occupied by
these tribes is in British Columbia.</p>

<p>This family was based by Gallatin upon the Koluschen tribe (the
Tshinkitani of Marchand), “who inhabit the islands and the adjacent
coast from the sixtieth to the fifty-fifth degree of north
latitude.”</p>

<p>In the Koluschan family, Gallatin observes that the remote analogies
to the Mexican tongue to be found in several of the northern tribes, as
the Kinai, are more marked than in any other.</p>

<p>The boundaries of this family as given by Gallatin are substantially
in accordance with our present knowledge of the subject. The southern
boundary is somewhat indeterminate owing to the fact, ascertained by the
census agents in 1880, that the Haida tribes extend somewhat farther
north than was formerly supposed and occupy the southeast half of Prince
of Wales Island. About latitude 56°, or the mouth of Portland Canal,
indicates the southern limit of the family, and 60°, or near the mouth
of Atna River, the northern limit. Until recently they have been
supposed to be exclusively
<span class="pagenum">87</span>
<a name="page087" id="page087"> </a>
an insular and coast people, but Mr. Dawson has made the interesting
discovery<a class="tag" name="tag63" id="tag63" href="#note63">63</a> that
the Tagish, a tribe living inland on the headwaters of the Lewis River,
who have hitherto been supposed to be of Athapascan extraction, belong
to the Koluschan family. This tribe, therefore, has crossed the coast
range of mountains, which for the most part limits the extension of this
people inland and confines them to a narrow coast strip, and have gained
a permanent foothold in the interior, where they share the habits of the
neighboring Athapascan tribes.</p>

<h6><a name="page088b" id="page088b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The main territory of the Kulanapan family is bounded on the west by
the Pacific Ocean, on the east by the Yukian and Copehan territories, on
the north by the watershed of the Russian River, and on the south by a
line drawn from Bodega Head to the southwest corner of the Yukian
territory, near Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, California. Several tribes of
this family, viz, the Kastel Pomo, Kai Pomo, and Kato Pomo, are located
in the valley between the South Fork of Eel River and the main river,
and on the headwaters of the South Fork, extending thence in a narrow
strip to the ocean. In this situation they were entirely cut off from
the main body by the intrusive Yuki tribes, and pressed upon from the
north by the warlike Wailakki, who are said to have imposed their
language and many of their customs upon them and as well doubtless to
have extensively intermarried with them.</p>

<p>The language is a homogeneous one and, according to Mr. Gatschet who

of the family, Klamath and Modoc, speaking an almost identical
language.</p>

<h6>GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</h6>

<p>The territory of the Mariposan family is quite irregular in outline.
On the north it is bounded by the Fresno River up to the point of its
junction with the San Joaquin; thence by a line running to the northeast
corner of the Salinan territory in San Benito County, California; on the
west by a line running from San Benito to Mount Pinos. From the middle
of the western shore of Tulare Lake to the ridge at Mount Pinos on the
south, the Mariposan area is merely a narrow strip in and along the
foothills. Occupying one-half of the western and all the southern shore
of Tulare Lake, and bounded on the north by a line running from the
southeast corner of Tulare Lake due east to the first great spur of the
Sierra Nevada range is the territory of the intrusive Shoshoni. On the
east the secondary range of the Sierra Nevada forms the Mariposan
boundary.</p>

<p>In addition to the above a small strip of territory on the eastern
bank of the San Joaquin is occupied by the Cholovone division of the
Mariposan family, between the Tuolumne and the point where the San
Joaquin turns to the west before entering Suisun Bay.</p>

<p>The Talatui mentioned by Hale<a class="tag" name="tag68" id="tag68" href="#note68">68</a> as on the Kassima (Cosumnes) River belong to the above
family. Though this author clearly distinguished the language from any
others with which he was acquainted, he nowhere expressed the opinion
that it is entitled to family rank or gave it a family name. Talatui is
mentioned as a tribe from which he obtained an incomplete
vocabulary.</p>

<p>It was not until 1856 that the distinctness of the linguistic family
was fully set forth by Latham. Under the head of Moquelumne, this author
gathers several vocabularies representing different languages and
dialects of the same stock. These are the Talatui of Hale, the Tuolumne
from Schoolcraft, the Sonoma dialects as represented by the Tshokoyem
vocabulary, the Chocuyem and Youkiousme paternosters, and the Olamentke
of Kostromitonov in Bäer’s Beiträge. He also places here provisionally
the paternosters from the Mission de Santa Clara and the Vallee de los
Tulares of Mofras; also the language Guiloco de la Mission de San
Francisco. The Costano containing the five tribes of the Mission of
Dolores, viz., the Ahwastes, Olhones or Costanos of the coast, Romonans,
Tulomos and the Altahmos seemed to Latham to differ from the Moquelumnan
language. Concerning them he states “upon the whole, however, the
affinities seem to run in the direction of the languages of the next
<span class="pagenum">93</span>
<a name="page093" id="page093"> </a>
group, especially in that of the Ruslen.<ins class="correction" title="close quote invisible in original">” </ins>He adds: “Nevertheless,
for the present I place the Costano by itself, as a transitional form of
speech to the languages spoken north, east, and south of the Bay of San
Francisco.” Recent investigation by Messrs. Curtin and Henshaw have
confirmed the soundness of Latham’s views and, as stated under head of
the Costanoan family, the two groups of languages are considered to be
distinct.</p>

of this family occupies also a territory bounded on the south by San
Francisco Bay and the western half of San Pablo Bay; on the west by the
Pacific Ocean from the Golden Gate to Bodega Head; on the north by a
line running from Bodega Head to the Yukian territory northeast of Santa

<p>Derivation: From the name of the principal tribe of the Creek
Confederacy.</p>

<p>In the Muskhogee family Gallatin includes the Muskhogees proper, who
lived on the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers; the Hitchittees, living on the
Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers; and the Seminoles of the peninsula of
Florida. It was his opinion, formed by a comparison of vocabularies,
that the Choctaws and Chickasaws should also be classed under this
family. In fact, he called<a class="tag" name="tag69" id="tag69" href="#note69">69</a> the family Choctaw Muskhogee. In deference, however, to
established usage, the two tribes were kept separate in his table and
upon the colored map. In 1848 he appears to be fully convinced of the
soundness of the view doubtfully expressed in 1836, and calls the family
the Chocta-Muskhog.</p>


<h6><a name="page094b" id="page094b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The area occupied by this family was very extensive. It may be
described in a general way as extending from the Savannah River and the
Atlantic west to the Mississippi, and from the Gulf of Mexico north to
the Tennessee River. All of this territory was held by Muskhogean tribes
except the small areas occupied by the Yuchi, Ná’htchi, and some small
settlements of Shawni.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">95</span>
<a name="page095" id="page095"> </a>
Upon the northeast Muskhogean limits are indeterminate. The Creek
claimed only to the Savannah River; but upon its lower course the Yamasi
are believed to have extended east of that river in the sixteenth to the
eighteenth century.<a class="tag" name="tag70" id="tag70" href="#note70">70</a> The territorial line between the Muskhogean family and
the Catawba tribe in South Carolina can only be conjectured.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the whole peninsula of Florida was at one time
held by tribes of Timuquanan connection; but from 1702 to 1708, when the
Apalachi were driven out, the tribes of northern Florida also were
forced away by the English. After that time the Seminole and the Yamasi
were the only Indians that held possession of the Floridian
peninsula.</p>

</div>

<p>The Na’htchi, according to Gallatin, a residue of the well-known
nation of that name, came from the banks of the Mississippi, and joined
the Creek less than one hundred years ago.<a class="tag" name="tag71"
href="#note71">71</a> The seashore from Mobile to the
Mississippi was then inhabited by several small tribes, of which the
Na’htchi was the principal.</p>

<p>Before 1730 the tribe lived in the vicinity of Natchez, Miss., along
St. Catherine Creek. After their dispersion by the French in 1730 most
of the remainder joined the Chicasa and afterwards the Upper Creek. They
are now in Creek and Cherokee Nations, Indian Territory.</p>

<p>The linguistic relations of the language spoken by the Taensa tribe
have long been in doubt, and it is probable that they will ever remain
so. As no vocabulary or text of this language was known to be in
existence, the “Grammaire et vocabulaire de la langue Taensa, avec
textes traduits et commentés par J.-D. Haumonté, Parisot, L. Adam,”
published in Paris in 1882, was received by American linguistic students
with peculiar interest. Upon the strength of the linguistic material
embodied in the above Mr. Gatschet (loc. cit.) was led to affirm the
complete linguistic isolation of the language.</p>

<p>Grave doubts of the authenticity of the grammar and vocabulary have,
however, more recently been brought forward.<a class="tag" name="tag72"
href="#note72">72</a> The text contains internal evidences of
the fraudulent character, if not of the whole, at least of a large part
of the material. So palpable and gross are these that until the
character of the whole can better be understood by the inspection of the
original manuscript, alleged to be in Spanish, by a competent expert it
will be far safer to reject both the vocabulary and grammar. By so doing
we are left without any linguistic evidence whatever of the relations of
the Taensa language.</p>

<p>D’Iberville, it is true, supplies us with the names of seven Taensa
towns which were given by a Taensa Indian who accompanied him; but most
of these, according to Mr. Gatschet, were given, in the Chicasa trade
jargon or, as termed by the French, the “Mobilian trade jargon,” which
is at least a very natural supposition. Under these circumstances we
can, perhaps, do no better than rely upon the statements of several of
the old writers who appear to be unanimous in regarding the language of
the Taensa as of Na’htchi connection. Du Pratz’s statement to that
effect is weakened from the fact that the statement also includes the
Shetimasha, the language of which is known from a vocabulary to be
totally distinct not only from the Na’htchi but from any other. To
supplement Du Pratz’s testimony, such as it is, we have the statements
of M. de Montigny, the
<span class="pagenum">97</span>
<a name="page097" id="page097"> </a>
missionary who affirmed the affinity of the Taensa language to that of
the Na’htchi, before he had visited the latter in 1699, and of Father
Gravier, who also visited them. For the present, therefore, the Taensa
language is considered to be a branch of the Na’htchi.</p>

<p>The Taensa formerly dwelt upon the Mississippi, above and close to
the Na’htchi. Early in the history of the French settlements a portion
of the Taensa, pressed upon by the Chicasa, fled and were settled by the
French upon Mobile Bay.</p>

Hale uses the terms Palaihnih and Palaiks interchangeably, but inasmuch
as on page 569, in his formal table of linguistic families and
languages, he calls the family Palaihnih, this is given preference over
the shorter form of the name.</p>

<p>Though here classed as a distinct family, the status of the Pit River
dialects can not be considered to be finally settled. Powers speaks of
the language as “hopelessly consonantal, harsh, and sesquipedalian,”
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* “utterly unlike the sweet and simple
<span class="pagenum">98</span>
<a name="page098" id="page098"> </a>
languages of the Sacramento.” He adds that the personal pronouns show it
to be a true Digger Indian tongue. Recent investigations by Mr. Gatschet
lead him, however, to believe that ultimately it will be found to be
linguistically related to the Sastean languages.</p>

<h6><a name="page098b" id="page098b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The family was located by Hale to the southeast of the Lutuami
(Klamath). They chiefly occupied the area drained by the Pit River in
extreme northeastern California. Some of the tribe were removed to Round
Valley Reservation, California.</p>

<p>Latham used the term Pima in 1850, citing under it three dialects or
languages. Subsequently, in 1856, he used the same term for one of the
five divisions into which he separates the languages of Sonora and
Sinaloa.</p>

<p>The same year Turner gave a brief account of Pima as a distinct
language, his remarks applying mainly to Pima proper of the Gila River,
Arizona. This tribe had been visited by Emory and Johnston and also
described by Bartlett. Turner refers to a short vocabulary in the
Mithridates, another of Dr. Coulter’s in Royal Geological Society
Journal, vol. <span class="smallroman">XI</span>, 1841, and a third by
Parry in Schoolcraft, Indian Tribes, vol. <span class="smallroman">III</span>, 1853. The short vocabulary he himself published
was collected by Lieut. Whipple.</p>

<p>Only a small portion of the territory occupied by this family is
included within the United States, the greater portion being in Mexico
where it extends to the Gulf of California. The family is represented in
the United States by three tribes, Pima alta, Sobaipuri, and Papago. The
former have lived for at least two centuries with the
<span class="pagenum">99</span>
<a name="page099" id="page099"> </a>
Maricopa on the Gila River about 160 miles from the mouth. The Sobaipuri
occupied the Santa Cruz and San Pedro Rivers, tributaries of the Gila,
but are no longer known. The Papago territory is much more extensive and
extends to the south across the border. In recent times the two tribes
have been separated, but the Pima territory as shown upon the map was
formerly continuous to the Gila River.</p>

<p>According to Buschmann, Gatschet, Brinton, and others the Pima
language is a northern branch of the Nahuatl, but this relationship has
yet to be demonstrated.<a class="tag" name="tag75" id="tag75" href="#note75">75</a></p>

<p>The following tribes were placed in this group by Latham: Pujuni,

were believed to be divided. “These races resembled one another in every

occupied the eastern bank of the Sacramento in California, beginning
some 80 or 100 miles from its mouth, and extended northward to within a
short distance of Pit River, where they met the tribes of the
Palaihnihan family. Upon the east they reached nearly to the border of
the State, the Palaihnihan, Shoshonean, and Washoan families hemming
them in in this direction.</p>

<p>This family name is equivalent to the Cahroc or Karok of Powers and
later authorities.</p>

<p>In 1853, as above cited, Gibbs gives Eh-nek as the titular heading of
his paragraphs upon the language of this family, with the remark
<span class="pagenum">101</span>
<a name="page101" id="page101"> </a>
that it is “The name of a band at the mouth of the Salmon, or Quoratem
river.” He adds that “This latter name may perhaps be considered as
proper to give to the family, should it be held one.” He defines the
territory occupied by the family as follows: “The language reaches from
Bluff creek, the upper boundary of the Pohlik, to about Clear creek,
thirty or forty miles above the Salmon; varying, however, somewhat from
point to point.”</p>

<p>The presentation of the name Quoratem, as above, seems sufficiently
formal, and it is therefore accepted for the group first indicated by
Gibbs.</p>

<p>In 1856 Latham renamed the family Ehnik, after the principal band,
locating the tribe, or rather the language, south of the Shasti and
Lutuami areas.</p>

occupy both banks of the lower Klamath from a range of hills a little
above Happy Camp to the junction of the Trinity, and the Salmon River
from its mouth to its sources. On the north, Quoratean tribes extended
to the Athapascan territory near the Oregon line.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: From river of same name.</p>

<p>The language formerly spoken at the Missions of San Antonio and San
Miguel in Monterey County, California, have long occupied a doubtful
position. By some they have been considered distinct, not only from each
other, but from all other languages. Others have held that they
represent distinct dialects of the Chumashan (Santa Barbara) group of
languages. Vocabularies collected in 1884 by Mr. Henshaw show clearly
that the two are closely connected dialects and that they are in no wise
related to any other family.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">102</span>
<a name="page102" id="page102"> </a>
The group established by Latham under the name Salinas is a
heterogeneous one, containing representatives of no fewer than four
distinct families. Gioloco, which he states “may possibly belong to this
group, notwithstanding its reference to the Mission of San Francisco,”
really is congeneric with the vocabularies assigned by Latham to the
Mendocinan family. The “Soledad of Mofras” belongs to the Costanoan
family mentioned on page 348 of the same essay, as also do the Ruslen
and Carmel. Of the three remaining forms of speech, Eslen, San Antonio,
and San Miguel, the two latter are related dialects, and belong within
the drainage of the Salinas River. The term Salinan is hence applied to
them, leaving the Eslen language to be provided with a name.</p>

<p><a name="page102b" id="page102b"><i>Population.</i>&mdash;</a>Though
the San Antonio and San Miguel were
probably never very populous tribes, the Missions of San Antonio and San
Miguel, when first established in the years 1771 and 1779, contained
respectively 1,400 and 1,300 Indians. Doubtless the larger number of
these converts were gathered in the near vicinity of the two missions
and so belonged to this family. In 1884 when Mr. Henshaw visited the
missions he was able to learn of the existence of only about a dozen
Indians of this family, and not all of these could speak their own
language.</p>

River, “which must be either the most southern branch of Clarke’s River
or the most northern branch of Lewis’s River.” The former supposition
was correct. As employed by Gallatin the family embraced only a single
tribe, the Flathead tribe proper. The Atnah, a Salishan tribe, were
considered by Gallatin to be distinct, and the name would be eligible as
the family
<span class="pagenum">104</span>

name; preference, however, is given to Salish. The few words from the
Friendly Village near the sources of the Salmon River given by Gallatin
in Archæologia Americana, <span class="smallroman">II</span>, 1836,
pp.&nbsp;15, 306, belong under this family.</p>


<h6><a name="page104b" id="page104b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>Since Gallatin’s time, through the labors of Riggs, Hale, Tolmie,
Dawson, Boas, and others, our knowledge of the territorial limits of
this linguistic family has been greatly extended. The most southern
outpost of the family, the Tillamook and Nestucca, were established on
the coast of Oregon, about 50 miles to the south of the Columbia, where
they were quite separated from their kindred to the north by the
Chinookan tribes. Beginning on the north side of Shoalwater Bay,
Salishan tribes held the entire northwestern part of Washington,
including the whole of the Puget Sound region, except only the Macaw
territory about Cape Flattery, and two insignificant spots, one near
Port Townsend, the other on the Pacific coast to the south of Cape
Flattery, which were occupied by Chimakuan tribes. Eastern Vancouver
Island to about midway of its length was also held by Salishan tribes,
while the great bulk of their territory lay on the mainland opposite and
included much of the upper Columbia. On the south they were hemmed in
mainly by the Shahaptian tribes. Upon the east Salishan tribes dwelt to
a little beyond the Arrow Lakes and their feeder, one of the extreme
north forks of the Columbia. Upon the southeast Salishan tribes extended
into Montana, including the upper drainage of the Columbia. They were
met here in 1804 by Lewis and Clarke. On the northeast Salish territory
extended to about the fifty-third parallel. In the northwest it did not
reach the Chilcat River.</p>

<p>Within the territory thus indicated there is considerable diversity
of customs and a greater diversity of language. The language is split
into a great number of dialects, many of which are doubtless mutually
unintelligible.</p>

<p>The relationship of this family to the Wakashan is a very interesting
problem. Evidences of radical affinity have been discovered by Boas and
Gatschet, and the careful study of their nature and extent now being
prosecuted by the former may result in the union of the two, though
until recently they have been considered quite distinct.</p>

the Klamath River and its tributaries from the western base of the
Cascade range to the point where the Klamath flows through the ridge of
hills east of Happy Camp, which forms the boundary between the Sastean
and the Quoratean families. In addition to this region of the Klamath,
the Shasta extended over the Siskiyou range northward as far as Ashland,

<p>Derivation: From a Selish word of unknown significance.</p>

<p>The Shahaptan family of Scouler comprised three tribes&mdash;the
Shahaptan or Nez Percés, the Kliketat, a scion of the Shahaptan,
dwelling near Mount Ranier, and the Okanagan, inhabiting the upper part
of Fraser River and its tributaries; “these tribes were asserted to
speak dialects of the same language.” Of the above tribes the Okinagan
are now known to be Salishan.</p>

<p>The vocabularies given by Scouler were collected by Tolmie. The term
“Sahaptin” appears on Gallatin’s map of 1836, where it doubtless refers
only to the Nez Percé tribe proper, with respect to whose linguistic
affinities Gallatin apparently knew nothing at the time. At all events
the name occurs nowhere in his discussion of the linguistic
families.</p>


<h6><a name="page107b" id="page107b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The tribes of this family occupied a large section of country along
the Columbia and its tributaries. Their western boundary was the Cascade
Mountains; their westernmost bands, the Klikitat on the north, the Tyigh
and Warm Springs on the south, enveloping for a short distance the
Chinook territory along the Columbia which extended to the Dalles.
Shahaptian tribes extended along the tributaries of the Columbia for a
considerable distance, their northern boundary being indicated by about
the forty-sixth parallel, their southern by about the forty-fourth.
Their eastern extension was interrupted by the Bitter Root
Mountains.</p>

<p>In his synopsis of the Indian tribes<a class="tag" name="tag78"
href="#note78">78</a> Gallatin’s reference to this great family is of
the most vague and unsatisfactory sort. He speaks of “some bands of
Snake Indians or Shoshonees, living on the waters of the river Columbia”
(p. 120), which is almost the only allusion to them to be found. The
only real claim he possesses to the authorship of the family name is to
be found on page 306, where, in his list
<span class="pagenum">109</span>
<a name="page109" id="page109"> </a>
of tribes and vocabularies, he places “Shoshonees” among his other
families, which is sufficient to show that he regarded them as a
distinct linguistic group. The vocabulary he possessed was by Say.</p>

<p>Buschmann, as above cited, classes the Shoshonean languages as a
northern branch of his Nahuatl or Aztec family, but the evidence
presented for this connection is deemed to be insufficient.</p>


<h6><a name="page109b" id="page109b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>This important family occupied a large part of the great interior
basin of the United States. Upon the north Shoshonean tribes extended
far into Oregon, meeting Shahaptian territory on about the forty-fourth
parallel or along the Blue Mountains. Upon the northeast the eastern
limits of the pristine habitat of the Shoshonean tribes are unknown. The
narrative of Lewis and Clarke<a class="tag" name="tag79" id="tag79" href="#note79">79</a> contains the explicit statement that the Shoshoni bands
encountered upon the Jefferson River, whose summer home was upon the
head waters of the Columbia, formerly lived within their own
recollection in the plains to the east of the Rocky Mountains, whence
they were driven to their mountain retreats by the Minnetaree (Atsina),
who had obtained firearms. Their former habitat thus given is indicated
upon the map, although the eastern limit is of course quite
indeterminate. Very likely much of the area occupied by the Atsina was
formerly Shoshonean territory. Later a division of the Bannock held the
finest portion of southwestern Montana,<a class="tag" name="tag80"
href="#note80">80</a> whence apparently they were being pushed
westward across the mountains by Blackfeet.<a class="tag" name="tag81"
href="#note81">81</a> Upon the east the Tukuarika or
Sheepeaters held the Yellowstone Park country, where they were bordered
by Siouan territory, while the Washaki occupied southwestern Wyoming.
Nearly the entire mountainous part of Colorado was held by the several
bands of the Ute, the eastern and southeastern parts of the State being
held respectively by the Arapaho and Cheyenne (Algonquian), and the
Kaiowe (Kiowan). To the southeast the Ute country included the northern
drainage of the San Juan, extending farther east a short distance into
New Mexico. The Comanche division of the family extended farther east
than any other. According to Crow tradition the Comanche formerly lived
northward in the Snake River region. Omaha tradition avers that the
Comanche were on the Middle Loup River, probably within the present
century. Bourgemont found a Comanche tribe on the upper Kansas River in
1724.<a class="tag" name="tag82" id="tag82" href="#note82">82</a> According
to Pike the Comanche territory bordered the Kaiowe on the north, the
former occupying the head waters of the upper Red River, Arkansas, and
Rio Grande.<a class="tag" name="tag83" id="tag83" href="#note83">83</a> How
<span class="pagenum">110</span>
<a name="page110" id="page110"> </a>
far to the southward Shoshonean tribes extended at this early period is
not known, though the evidence tends to show that they raided far down
into Texas to the territory they have occupied in more recent years,
viz, the extensive plains from the Rocky Mountains eastward into Indian
Territory and Texas to about 97°. Upon the south Shoshonean territory
was limited generally by the Colorado River. The Chemehuevi lived on
both banks of the river between the Mohave on the north and the Cuchan
on the south, above and below Bill Williams Fork.<a class="tag" name="tag84"
href="#note84">84</a> The Kwaiantikwoket also lived to the
east of the river in Arizona about Navajo Mountain, while the Tusayan
(Moki) had established their seven pueblos, including one founded by
people of Tañoan stock, to the east of the Colorado Chiquito. In the
southwest Shoshonean tribes had pushed across California, occupying a
wide band of country to the Pacific. In their extension northward they
had reached as far as Tulare Lake, from which territory apparently they
had dispossessed the Mariposan tribes, leaving a small remnant of that
linguistic family near Fort Tejon.<a class="tag" name="tag85" id="tag85" href="#note85">85</a></p>

<p>A little farther north they had crossed the Sierras and occupied the
heads of San Joaquin and Kings Rivers. Northward they occupied nearly
the whole of Nevada, being limited on the west by the Sierra Nevada. The
entire southeastern part of Oregon was occupied by tribes of Shoshoni
extraction.</p>

<p>Derivation: A corruption of the Algonkin word “nadowe-ssi-wag<ins class="correction" title="close quote missing">,”</ins> “the
snake-like ones,” “the enemies” (Trumbull).</p>

<p>Under the family Gallatin makes four subdivisions, viz, the
Winnebagos, the Sioux proper and the Assiniboins, the Minnetare group,
and the Osages and southern kindred tribes. Gallatin speaks of the
distribution of the family as follows: The Winnebagoes have their
principal seats on the Fox River of Lake Michigan and towards the heads
of the Rock River of the Mississippi; of the Dahcotas proper, the
Mendewahkantoan or “Gens du Lac” lived east of the Mississippi from
Prairie du Chien north to Spirit Lake. The three others, Wahkpatoan,
Wahkpakotoan and Sisitoans inhabit the country between the Mississippi
and the St. Peters, and that on the southern tributaries of this river
and on the headwaters of the Red River of Lake Winnipek. The three
western tribes, the Yanktons, the Yanktoanans and the Tetons wander
between the Mississippi and the Missouri, extending southerly to 43° of
north latitude and some distance west of the Missouri, between 43° and
47° of latitude.
<span class="pagenum">112</span>
<a name="page112" id="page112"> </a>
The “Shyennes” are included in the family but are marked as doubtfully
belonging here.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that “Sioux” is a word of reproach and means snake
or enemy, the term has been discarded by many later writers as a family
designation, and “Dakota,” which signifies friend or ally, has been
employed in its stead. The two words are, however, by no means properly
synonymous. The term “Sioux” was used by Gallatin in a comprehensive or
family sense and was applied to all the tribes collectively known to him
to speak kindred dialects of a widespread language. It is in this sense
only, as applied to the linguistic family, that the term is here
employed. The term “Dahcota” (Dakota) was correctly applied by Gallatin
to the Dakota tribes proper as distinguished from the other members of
the linguistic family who are not Dakotas in a tribal sense. The use of
the term with this signification should be perpetuated.</p>

<p>It is only recently that a definite decision has been reached
respecting the relationship of the Catawba and Woccon, the latter an
extinct tribe known to have been linguistically related to the Catawba.
Gallatin thought that he was able to discern some affinities of the
Catawban language with “Muskhogee and even with Choctaw,” though these
were not sufficient to induce him to class them together. Mr. Gatschet
was the first to call attention to the presence in the Catawba language
of a considerable number of words having a Siouan affinity.</p>

<p>Recently Mr. Dorsey has made a critical examination of all the
Catawba linguistic material available, which has been materially
increased by the labors of Mr. Gatschet, and the result seems to justify
its inclusion as one of the dialects of the widespread Siouan
family.</p>


<h6><a name="page112b" id="page112b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The pristine territory of this family was mainly in one body, the
only exceptions being the habitats of the Biloxi, the Tutelo, the
Catawba and Woccon.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular opinion of the present day, the general trend
of Siouan migration has been westward. In comparatively late prehistoric
times, probably most of the Siouan tribes dwelt east of the Mississippi
River.</p>

<p>The main Siouan territory extended from about 53° north in the Hudson
Bay Company Territory, to about 33°, including a considerable part of
the watershed of the Missouri River and that of the Upper Mississippi.
It was bounded on the northwest, north, northeast, and for some distance
on the east by Algonquian territory. South of 45° north the line ran
eastward to Lake Michigan, as the Green Bay region belonged to the
Winnebago.<a class="tag" name="tag86" id="tag86" href="#note86">86</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">113</span>
<a name="page113" id="page113"> </a>
It extended westward from Lake Michigan through Illinois, crossing the
Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien. At this point began the
Algonquian territory (Sac, etc.) on the west side of the Mississippi,
extending southward to the Missouri, and crossing that river it returned
to the Mississippi at St. Louis. The Siouan tribes claimed all of the
present States of Iowa and Missouri, except the parts occupied by
Algonquian tribes. The dividing line between the two for a short
distance below St. Louis was the Mississippi River. The line then ran
west of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot Counties, in Missouri, and
Mississippi County and those parts of Craighead and Poinsett Counties,
Arkansas, lying east of the St. Francis River. Once more the Mississippi
became the eastern boundary, but in this case separating the Siouan from
the Muskhogean territory. The Quapaw or Akansa were the most southerly
tribe in the main Siouan territory. In 1673<a class="tag" name="tag87"
href="#note87">87</a> they were east of the Mississippi.
Joutel (1687) located two of their villages on the Arkansas and two on
the Mississippi one of the latter being on the east bank, in our present
State of Mississippi, and the other being on the opposite side, in
Arkansas. Shea says<a class="tag" name="tag88" id="tag88" href="#note88">88</a> that the Kaskaskias were found by De Soto in 1540 in
latitude 36°, and that the Quapaw were higher up the Mississippi. But we
know that the southeast corner of Missouri and the northeast corner of
Arkansas, east of the St. Francis River, belonged to Algonquian tribes.
A study of the map of Arkansas shows reason for believing that there may
have been a slight overlapping of habitats, or a sort of debatable
ground. At any rate it seems advisable to compromise, and assign the
Quapaw and Osage (Siouan tribes) all of Arkansas up to about 36°
north.</p>

<p>On the southwest of the Siouan family was the Southern Caddoan group,
the boundary extending from the west side of the Mississippi River in
Louisiana, nearly opposite Vicksburg, Mississippi, and running
northwestwardly to the bend of Red River between Arkansas and Louisiana;
thence northwest along the divide between the watersheds of the Arkansas
and Red Rivers. In the northwest corner of Indian Territory the Osages
came in contact with the Comanche (Shoshonean), and near the western
boundary of Kansas the Kiowa, Cheyenne, and Arapaho (the two latter
being recent Algonquian intruders?) barred the westward march of the
Kansa or Kaw.</p>

<p>The Pawnee group of the Caddoan family in western Nebraska and
northwestern Kansas separated the Ponka and Dakota on the north from the
Kansa on the south, and the Omaha and other Siouan tribes on the east
from Kiowa and other tribes on the west. The Omaha and cognate peoples
occupied in Nebraska the lower part of the Platte River, most of the
Elkhorn Valley, and the Ponka claimed the region watered by the Niobrara
in northern Nebraska.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">114</span>
<a name="page114" id="page114"> </a>
There seems to be sufficient evidence for assigning to the Crows
(Siouan) the northwest corner of Nebraska (i.e., that part north of the
Kiowan and Caddoan habitats) and the southwest part of South Dakota (not
claimed by Cheyenne<a class="tag" name="tag89" id="tag89" href="#note89">89</a>), as well as the northern part of Wyoming and the
southern part of Montana, where they met the Shoshonean stock.<a class="tag" name="tag90"
href="#note90">90</a></p>

<p>The Biloxi habitat in 1699 was on the Pascogoula river,<a class="tag" name="tag91"
href="#note91">91</a> in the southeast corner of
the present State of Mississippi. The Biloxi subsequently removed to
Louisiana, where a few survivors were found by Mr. Gatschet in 1886.</p>

<p>The Tutelo habitat in 1671 was in Brunswick County, southern
Virginia, and it probably included Lunenburgh and Mecklenburg
Counties.<a class="tag" name="tag92" id="tag92" href="#note92">92</a> The
Earl of Bellomont (1699) says<a class="tag" name="tag93" id="tag93" href="#note93">93</a> that the Shateras were “supposed to be the Toteros, on
Big Sandy River, Virginia,” and Pownall, in his map of North America
(1776), gives the Totteroy (i.e., Big Sandy) River. Subsequently to 1671
the Tutelo left Virginia and moved to North Carolina.<a class="tag" name="tag94"
href="#note94">94</a> They returned to Virginia (with
the Sapona), joined the Nottaway and Meherrin, whom they and the
Tuscarora followed into Pennsylvania in the last century; thence they
went to New York, where they joined the Six Nations, with whom they
removed to Grand River Reservation, Ontario, Canada, after the
Revolutionary war. The last full-blood Tutelo died in 1870. For the
important discovery of the Siouan affinity of the Tutelo language we are
indebted to Mr. Hale.</p>

<p>The Catawba lived on the river of the same name on the northern
boundary of South Carolina. Originally they were a powerful tribe, the
leading people of South Carolina, and probably occupied a large part of
the Carolinas. The Woccon were widely separated from kinsmen living in
North Carolina in the fork of the Cotentnea and Neuse Rivers.</p>

<p>The Wateree, living just below the Catawba, were very probably of the
same linguistic connection.</p>

</div>

<p>The vocabulary referred by Gallatin<a class="tag" name="tag95"
href="#note95">95</a> to “Queen Charlotte’s Islands” unquestionably
belongs to the present family. In addition to being a compound word and
being objectionable as a family name on account of its unwieldiness, the
term is a purely geographic one and is based upon no stated tribe; hence
it is not eligible for use in systematic nomenclature. As it appears in
the Archæologia Americana it represents nothing but the locality whence
the vocabulary of an unknown tribe was received.</p>

<p>The family name to be considered as next in order of date is the
Northern (or Haidah) of Scouler, which appears in volume <span class="smallroman">XI</span>, Royal Geographical Society, page 218, et seq.
The term as employed by Scouler is involved in much confusion, and it is
somewhat difficult to determine just what tribes the author intended to
cover by the designation. Reduced to its simplest form, the case stands
as follows: Scouler’s primary division of the Indians of the Northwest
was into two groups, the insular and the inland. The insular (and coast
tribes) were then subdivided into two families, viz, Northern or Haidah
family (for the terms are interchangeably used, as on page 224) and the
Southern or Nootka-Columbian family. Under the Northern or Haidah family
the author classes all the Indian tribes
<span class="pagenum">120</span>
<a name="page120" id="page120"> </a>
in the Russian territory, the Kolchians (Athapascas of Gallatin, 1836),
the Koloshes, Ugalentzes, and Tun Ghaase (the Koluscans of Gallatin,
1836); the Atnas (Salish of Gallatin, 1836); the Kenaians (Athapascas,
Gallatin, 1836); the Haidah tribes proper of Queen Charlotte Island, and
the Chimesyans.</p>

<p>It will appear at a glance that such a heterogeneous assemblage of
tribes, representing as they do several distinct stocks, can not have
been classed together on purely linguistic evidence. In point of fact,
Scouler’s remarkable classification seems to rest only in a very slight
degree upon a linguistic basis, if indeed it can be said to have a
linguistic basis at all. Consideration of “physical character, manners,
and customs” were clearly accorded such weight by this author as to
practically remove his Northern or Haidah family from the list of
linguistic stocks.</p>

<p>The next family name which was applied in this connection is the
Skittagets of Gallatin as above cited. This name is given to designate a
family on page <i>c</i>, volume <span class="smallroman">II</span>, of
Transactions of the Ethnological Society, 1848. In his subsequent list
of vocabularies, page 77, he changes his designation to Queen Charlotte
Island, placing under this family name the Skittagete tribe. His
presentation of the former name of Skittagets in his complete list of
families is, however, sufficiently formal to render it valid as a family
designation, and it is, therefore, retained for the tribes of the Queen
Charlotte Archipelago which have usually been called Haida.</p>

<p>From a comparison of the vocabularies of the Haida language with
others of the neighboring Koluschan family, Dr. Franz Boas is inclined
to consider that the two are genetically related. The two languages
possess a considerable number of words in common, but a more thorough
investigation is requisite for the settlement of the question than has
yet been given. Pending this the two families are here treated
separately.</p>


<h6><a name="page120b" id="page120b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The tribes of this family occupy Queen Charlotte Islands, Forrester
Island to the north of the latter, and the southeastern part of Prince
of Wales Island, the latter part having been ascertained by the agents

<div class="tribename">

<p>= Takilma, Gatschet in Mag. Am. Hist., 1882 (Lower Rogue River).</p>

</div>

<p>This name was proposed by Mr. Gatschet for a distinct language spoken
on the coast of Oregon about the lower Rogue River. Mr. Dorsey obtained
a vocabulary in 1884 which he has compared with Athapascan, Kusan,
Yakonan, and other languages spoken in the region without finding any
marked resemblances. The family is hence admitted provisionally. The
language appears to be spoken by but a single tribe, although there is a
manuscript vocabulary in the Bureau of Ethnology exhibiting certain
differences which may be dialectic.</p>


<h6><a name="page121d" id="page121d">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The Takilma formerly dwelt in villages along upper Rogue River,
Oregon, all the latter, with one exception, being on the south side,
from Illinois River on the southwest, to Deep Rock, which was nearer the
head of the stream. They are now included among the “Rogue River
Indians,” and they reside to the number of twenty-seven on the Siletz
Reservation, Tillamook County, Oregon, where Dorsey found them in
1884.</p>

Derivation: Probably from “taínin,” plural of tá-ide, “Indian,” in the
dialect of Isleta and Sandia (Gatschet).</p>

<p>In a letter<a class="tag" name="tag97" id="tag97" href="#note97">97</a>
from Wm. Carr Lane to H.&nbsp;R. Schoolcraft, appear some remarks on the
affinities of the Pueblo languages, based in large part on hearsay
evidence. No vocabularies are given, nor does any real classification
appear to be attempted, though referring to such of his remarks as apply
in the present connection, Lane states that the Indians of “Taos,
Vicuris, Zesuqua, Sandia, and Ystete, and of two pueblos of Texas, near
El Paso, are said to speak the same language, which I have heard called
E-nagh-magh,” and that the Indians of “San Juan, Santa Clara, Pojuaque,
Nambe, San Il de Conso, and one Moqui pueblo, all speak the same
language, as it is said: this I have heard called Tay-waugh.” The
ambiguous nature of his reference to these pueblos is apparent from the
above quotation.</p>

<p>The names given by Lane as those he had “heard” applied to certain
groups of pueblos which “it&nbsp;is said” speak the same language,
rest on too slender a basis for serious consideration in a
classificatory sense.</p>

<p>Keane in the appendix to Stanford’s Compendium (Central and South
America), 1878, p.&nbsp;479, presents the list given by Lane, correcting
his spelling in some cases and adding the name of the Tusayan pueblo as
Haro (Hano). He gives the group no formal family name, though they are
classed together as speaking “Tegua or Tay-waugh.”</p>

<p>The Taño of Powell (1878), as quoted, appears to be the first name
formally given the family, and is therefore accepted. Recent
investigations of the dialect spoken at Taos and some of the other
pueblos of this group show a considerable body of words having
Shoshonean affinities, and it is by no means improbable that further
research will result in proving the radical relationship of these
languages to the Shoshonean family. The analysis of the language has not
yet, however, proceeded far enough to warrant a decided opinion.</p>


<h6><a name="page122b" id="page122b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The tribes of this family in the United States resided exclusively
upon the Rio Grande and its tributary valleys from about 33° to about
36°. A&nbsp;small body of these people joined the Tusayan in northern
Arizona, as tradition avers to assist the latter against attacks by the
Apache&mdash;though it seems more probable that they fled from the Rio
Grande during the pueblo revolt of 1680&mdash;and remained to found the
permanent pueblo of Hano, the seventh pueblo of the group. A smaller
section of the family lived upon the Rio Grande in Mexico and Texas,
just over the New Mexico border.</p>

<p>Derivation: From ati-muca, “ruler,” “master;” literally, “servants

<p>In the Historical Magazine as above cited appears a notice of the
Timuquana language by Buckingham Smith, in which is affirmed its
distinctness upon the evidence of language. A short vocabulary is
appended, which was collated from the “Confessionario” by Padre Pareja,
1613. Brinton and Gatschet have studied the Timuquana language and have
agreed as to the distinctness of the family from any other of the United
States. Both the latter authorities are inclined to take the view that
it has affinities with the Carib family to the southward, and it seems
by no means improbable that ultimately the Timuquana language will be
considered an offshoot of the Carib linguistic stock. At the present
time, however, such a conclusion would not be justified by the evidence
gathered and published.</p>


<h6><a name="page123c" id="page123c">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>It is impossible to assign definite limits to the area occupied by
the tribes of this family. From documentary testimony of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries the limits of the family domain appear to have
been about as follows: In general terms the present northern limits of
the State of Florida may be taken as the northern frontier, although
upon the Atlantic side Timuquanan territory may have extended into
Georgia. Upon the northwest the boundary line was formed in De Soto’s
time by the Ocilla River. Lake Okeechobee on the south, or as it was
then called Lake Sarrape or Mayaimi, may be taken as the boundary
between the Timuquanan tribes proper and the Calusa province upon the
Gulf coast and the Tegesta province upon the Atlantic side. Nothing
whatever of the languages
<span class="pagenum">124</span>
<a name="page124" id="page124"> </a>
spoken in these two latter provinces is available for comparison. A
number of the local names of these provinces given by Fontanedo (1559)
have terminations similar to many of the Timuquanan local names. This
slender evidence is all that we have from which to infer the Timuquanan
relationship of the southern end of the peninsula.</p>

<p>The distinctness of the Tonika language, has long been suspected, and
was indeed distinctly stated by Dr. Sibley in 1806.<a class="tag" name="tag98"
href="#note98">98</a> The statement to this effect by Dr.
Sibley was quoted by Gallatin in 1836, but as the latter possessed no
vocabulary of the language he made no attempt to classify it. Latham
also dismisses the language with the same quotation from Sibley.
Positive linguistic proof of the position of the language was lacking
until obtained by Mr. Gatschet in 1886, who declared it to form a family
by itself.</p>


<h6><a name="page125c" id="page125c">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The Tonika are known to have occupied three localities: First, on the
Lower Yazoo River (1700); second, east shore of Mississippi River (about
1704); third, in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana (1817). Near Marksville,
the county seat of that parish, about twenty-five are now living.</p>

<p>The Tónkawa were a migratory people and a <i>colluvies gentium</i>,
whose earliest habitat is unknown. Their first mention occurs in 1719;
at that time and ever since they roamed in the western and southern
parts of what is now Texas. About 1847 they were engaged as scouts in
the United States Army, and from 1860-’62 (?) were in the Indian
Territory; after the secession war till 1884 they lived in temporary
camps near Fort Griffin, Shackelford County, Texas, and in October,
1884, they removed to the Indian Territory (now on Oakland Reserve). In
1884 there were seventy-eight individuals living; associated with them
were nineteen Lipan Apache, who had lived in their company for many
years, though in a separate camp. They have thirteen divisions (partly
totem-clans) and observe mother-right.</p>

</div>

<p>The following is the account of this tribe given by Gallatin
(probably derived from Hawkins) in Archæologia Americana, page&nbsp;95:</p>

<blockquote>
The original seats of the Uchees were east of Coosa and probably of the
Chatahoochee; and they consider themselves as the most ancient
inhabitants of the country. They may have been the same nation which is
called Apalaches in the accounts of De Soto’s expedition, and their
towns were till lately principally on Flint River.</blockquote>


<h6><a name="page126c" id="page126c">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The pristine homes of the Yuchi are not now traceable with any degree
of certainty. The Yuchi are supposed to have been visited by De Soto
during his memorable march, and the town of Cofitachiqui chronicled by
him, is believed by many investigators to have stood at Silver Bluff, on
the left bank of the Savannah, about 25 miles below Augusta. If, as is
supposed by some authorities, Cofitachiqui was a Yuchi town, this would
locate the Yuchi in a section which, when first known to the whites, was
occupied by the Shawnee. Later the Yuchi appear to have lived somewhat
farther down the Savannah, on the eastern and also the western side, as
far as the Ogeechee River, and also upon tracts above and below Augusta,
Georgia. These tracts were claimed by them as late as 1736.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">127</span>
<a name="page127" id="page127"> </a>
In 1739 a portion of the Yuchi left their old seats and settled among
the Lower Creek on the Chatahoochee River; there they established three
colony villages in the neighborhood, and later on a Yuchi settlement is
mentioned on Lower Tallapoosa River, among the Upper Creek.<a class="tag" name="tag99"
href="#note99">99</a> Filson<a class="tag" name="tag100"
href="#note100">100</a> gives a list of thirty Indian
tribes and a statement concerning Yuchi towns, which he must have
obtained from a much earlier source: “Uchees occupy four different
places of residence&mdash;at the head of St. John’s, the fork of St.
Mary’s, the head of Cannouchee, and the head of St. Tillis” (Satilla),
etc.<a class="tag" name="tag101" id="tag101" href="#note101">101</a></p>

<p><a name="page127b" id="page127b"><i>Population.</i>&mdash;</a>More
than six hundred Yuchi reside in
northeastern Indian Territory, upon the Arkansas River, where they are
usually classed as Creek. Doubtless the latter are to some extent
intermarried with them, but the Yuchi are jealous of their name and
tenacious of their position as a tribe.</p>

<p>Derivation: <ins class="correction" title="both duplications in original">Waukash, waukash</ins>, is the Nootka
word <ins class="correction" title="both duplications in original">“good” “good.”</ins> When
heard by Cook at Friendly Cove, Nootka Sound, it was supposed to be the
name of the tribe.</p>

<p>Until recently the languages spoken by the Aht of the west coast of
Vancouver Island and the Makah of Cape Flattery, congeneric tribes, and
the Haeltzuk and Kwakiutl peoples of the east coast of Vancouver Island
and the opposite mainland of British Columbia, have been regarded as
representing two distinct families. Recently Dr. Boas has made an
extended study of these languages, has collected excellent vocabularies
of the supposed families, and as a result of his study it is now
possible to unite them on the basis of radical affinity. The main body
of the vocabularies of the two languages is remarkably distinct, though
a considerable number of important words are shown to be common to the
two.</p>

<p>Dr. Boas, however, points out that in both languages suffixes only
are used in forming words, and a long list of these shows remarkable
similarity.</p>

<p>The above family name was based upon a vocabulary of the Wakash
Indians, who, according to Gallatin, “inhabit the island on which Nootka
Sound is situated.” The short vocabulary given was collected by Jewitt.
Gallatin states<a class="tag" name="tag103" id="tag103" href="#note103">103</a> that this language is the one “in&nbsp;that quarter,
which, by various vocabularies, is best known to us.” In 1848<a class="tag" name="tag104"
href="#note104">104</a> Gallatin repeats his
Wakash family, and again gives the vocabulary of Jewitt. There would
thus seem to be no doubt of his intention to give it formal rank as a
family.</p>

<p>The term “Wakash” for this group of languages has since been
generally ignored, and in its place Nootka or Nootka-Columbian has been
adopted. “Nootka-Columbian” was employed by Scouler in 1841 for a group
of languages, extending from the mouth of Salmon
<span class="pagenum">130</span>
<a name="page130" id="page130"> </a>
River to the south of the Columbia River, now known to belong to several
distinct families. “Nootka family” was also employed by Hale<a class="tag" name="tag105"
href="#note105">105</a> in 1846, who proposed
the name for the tribes of Vancouver Island and those along the south
side of the Straits of Fuca.</p>

<p>The term “Nootka-Columbian” is strongly condemned by Sproat.<a class="tag" name="tag106"
href="#note106">106</a> For the group of
related tribes on the west side of Vancouver Island this author suggests
Aht, “house, tribe, people,” as a much more appropriate family
appellation.</p>

<p>Though by no means as appropriate a designation as could be found, it
seems clear that for the so-called Wakash, Newittee, and other allied
languages usually assembled under the Nootka family, the term Wakash of
1836 has priority and must be retained.</p>


<h6><a name="page130b" id="page130b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The tribes of the Aht division of this family are confined chiefly to
the west coast of Vancouver Island. They range to the north as far as
Cape Cook, the northern side of that cape being occupied by Haeltzuk
tribes, as was ascertained by Dr. Boas in 1886. On the south they
reached to a little above Sooke Inlet, that inlet being in possession of
the Soke, a Salishan tribe.</p>

<p>The neighborhood of Cape Flattery, Washington, is occupied by the
Makah, one of the Wakashan tribes, who probably wrested this outpost of
the family from the Salish (Clallam) who next adjoin them on Puget
Sound.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the Haeltzuk division of this family are laid down
nearly as they appear on Tolmie and Dawson’s linguistic map of 1884. The
west side of King Island and Cascade Inlet are said by Dr. Boas to be
inhabited by Haeltzuk tribes, and are colored accordingly.</p>

<p>Derivation: Weitspek is the name of a tribe or village of the family
situated on Klamath River. The etymology is unknown.</p>

<p>Gibbs was the first to employ this name, which he did in 1853, as
<span class="pagenum">132</span>
<a name="page132" id="page132"> </a>
above cited. He states that it is “the name of the principal band on the
Klamath, at the junction of the Trinity,” adding that “this language
prevails from a few miles above that point to the coast, but does not
extend far from the river on either side.” It would thus seem clear that
in this case, as in several others, he selected the name of a band to
apply to the language spoken by it. The language thus defined has been
accepted as distinct by later authorities except Latham, who included as
dialects under the Weitspek language, the locality of which he gives as
the junction of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers, the Weyot and Wishosk,
both of which are now classed under the Wishoskan family.</p>

<p>By the Karok these tribes are called Yurok, “down” or “below,” by
which name the family has recently been known.</p>

from the mouth of the Trinity down. Upon the coast, Weitspekan territory
extends from Gold Bluff to about 6 miles above the mouth of the Klamath.

Derivation: From yakwina, signifying “spirit” (Everette).</p>

<p>The Yakwina was the leading tribe of this family. It must have been
of importance in early days, as it occupied fifty-six villages along
Yaquina River, from the site of Elk City down to the ocean. Only a few
survive, and they are with the Alsea on the Siletz Reservation,
Tillamook County, Oregon. They were classed by mistake with the
Tillamook or “Killamucks” by Lewis and Clarke. They are called by Lewis
and Clarke<a class="tag" name="tag111" id="tag111" href="#note111">111</a>
Youikcones and Youkone.<a class="tag" name="tag112" id="tag112" href="#note112">112</a></p>

<p>The Alsea formerly dwelt in villages along both sides of Alsea River,
Oregon, and on the adjacent coast. They are now on the Siletz
Reservation, Oregon. Perhaps a few are on the Grande Ronde Reservation,
Oregon.</p>

<p>The Siuslaw used to inhabit villages on the Siuslaw River, Oregon.
There may be a few pure Siuslaw on the Siletz Reservation, but Mr.
Dorsey did not see any of them. They are mentioned by Drew,<a class="tag" name="tag113"
href="#note113">113</a> who includes them among
the “Kat-la-wot-sett” bands. At that time, they were still on the
Siuslaw River. The Ku-itc or Lower Umpqua villages were on both sides of
the lower part of Umpqua River, Oregon, from its mouth upward for about
30 miles. Above them were the Upper Umpqua villages, of the Athapascan
stock. A few members of the Ku-itc still reside on the Siletz
Reservation, Oregon.</p>

<p>This is a family based by Hale upon a single tribe, numbering six or
seven hundred, who live on the coast, north of the Nsietshawus, from
whom they differ merely in language. Hale calls the tribe Iakon or
Yakones or Southern Killamuks.</p>

<p>The Sayúsklan language has usually been assumed to be distinct from
all others, and the comments of Latham and others all tend in this
direction. Mr. Gatschet, as above quoted, finally classed it as a
distinct stock, at the same time finding certain strong coincidences
with the Yakonan family. Recently Mr. Dorsey has collected extensive
vocabularies of the Yakonan, Sayúskla, and Lower Umpqua languages and
finds unquestioned evidence of relationship.</p>


<h6><a name="page134b" id="page134b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The family consists of four primary divisions or tribes: Yakwina,
Alsea, Siuslaw, and Ku-itc or Lower Umpqua. Each one of these comprised
many villages, which were stretched along the western part of Oregon on
the rivers flowing into the Pacific, from the Yaquina on the north down
to and including the Umpqua River.</p>

</div>


<p>Derivation: Yana means “people” in the Yanan language.</p>

<p>In 1880 Powell collected a short vocabulary from this tribe, which is
chiefly known to the settlers by the name Noje or Nozi. Judged by this
vocabulary the language seemed to be distinct from any other. More
recently, in 1884, Mr. Curtin visited the remnants of the tribe,
consisting of thirty-five individuals, and obtained an extensive
collection of words, the study of which seems to confirm the impression
of the isolated position of the language as regards other American
tongues.</p>

<p>The Nozi seem to have been a small tribe ever since known to
Europeans. They have a tradition to the effect that they came to
California from the far East. Powers states that they differ markedly in
physical traits from all California tribes met by him. At present the
Nozi are reduced to two little groups, one at Redding, the other in
their original country at Round Mountain, California.</p>


<h6><a name="page135c" id="page135c">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The eastern boundary of the Yanan territory is formed by a range of
mountains a little west of Lassen Butte and terminating near Pit River;
the northern boundary by a line running from northeast to southwest,
passing near the northern side of Round Mountain, 3 miles from Pit
River. The western boundary from Redding southward is on an average 10
miles to the east of the Sacramento. North of Redding it averages double

<p>Derivation: A Cuchan word signifying “sons of the river” (Whipple).</p>

<p>In 1856 Turner adopted Yuma as a family name, and placed under it
Cuchan, Coco-Maricopa, Mojave and Diegeno.</p>

<p>Three years previously (1853) Latham<a class="tag" name="tag114" id="tag114" href="#note114">114</a> speaks of the Dieguno language, and discusses
with it several others, viz, San Diego, Cocomaricopa, Cuohañ, Yuma,
Amaquaqua (Mohave), etc. Though he seems to consider these languages as
allied, he gives no indication that he believes them to collectively
represent a family, and he made no formal family division. The context
is not, however, sufficiently clear to render his position with respect
to their exact status as precise as is to be desired, but it is
tolerably certain that he did not mean to make Diegueño a family name,
for in the volume of the same society for 1856 he includes both the
Diegueño and the other above mentioned tribes in the Yuma family, which
is here fully set forth. As he makes no allusion to having previously
established a family name for the same group of languages, it seems
pretty certain that he did not do so, and that the term Diegueño as a
family name may be eliminated from consideration. It thus appears that
the family name Yuma was proposed by both the above authors during the
same year. For, though part 3 of vol. <span class="smallroman">III</span> of Pacific Railroad Reports, in which Turner’s
article is published, is dated 1855, it appears from a foot-note (p. 84)
that his paper was not handed to Mr. Whipple till January, 1856, the
date of title page of volume, and that his proof was going through the
press during the month of May, which is the month (May 9) that Latham’s
paper was read before the Philological Society. The fact that Latham’s
article was not read until May 9 enables us to establish priority of
publication in favor of Turner with a reasonable degree of certainty, as
doubtless a considerable period elapsed between the presentation of
Latham’s paper to the society and its final publication, upon which
latter must rest its claim. The Yuma of Turner is therefore adopted as
of precise date and of undoubted application. Pimentel makes Yuma a part
of Piman stock.</p>


<h6><a name="page137b" id="page137b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The center of distribution of the tribes of this family is generally
considered to be the lower Colorado and Gila Valleys. At least this
<span class="pagenum">138</span>
<a name="page138" id="page138"> </a>
is the region where they attained their highest physical and mental
development. With the exception of certain small areas possessed by
Shoshonean tribes, Indians of Yuman stock occupied the Colorado River
from its mouth as far up as Cataract Creek where dwell the Havasupai.
Upon the Gila and its tributaries they extended as far east as the Tonto
Basin. From this center they extended west to the Pacific and on the
south throughout the peninsula of Lower California. The mission of San
Luis Rey in California was, when established, in Yuman territory, and
marks the northern limit of the family. More recently and at the present
time this locality is in possession of Shoshonean tribes.</p>

<p>The island of Angel de la Guardia and Tiburon Island were occupied by
tribes of the Yuman family, as also was a small section of Mexico lying
on the gulf to the north of Guaymas.</p>

<p>Derivation: From the Cochití term Suinyi, said to mean “the people of
the long nails,” referring to the surgeons of Zuñi who always wear some
of their nails very long (Cushing).</p>

<p>Turner was able to compare the Zuñi language with the Keran, and his
conclusion that they were entirely distinct has been fully
<span class="pagenum">139</span>
<a name="page139" id="page139"> </a>
substantiated. Turner had vocabularies collected by Lieut. Simpson and
by Capt. Eaton, and also one collected by Lieut. Whipple.</p>

<p>The small amount of linguistic material accessible to the earlier
writers accounts for the little done in the way of classifying the
Pueblo languages. Latham possessed vocabularies of the Moqui, Zuñi,
A´coma or Laguna, Jemez, Tesuque, and Taos or Picuri. The affinity of
the Tusayan (Moqui) tongue with the Comanche and other Shoshonean
languages early attracted attention, and Latham pointed it out with some
particularity. With the other Pueblo languages he does little, and
attempts no classification into stocks.</p>


<h6><a name="page139b" id="page139b">GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.</a></h6>

<p>The Zuñi occupy but a single permanent pueblo, on the Zuñi River,
western New Mexico. Recently, however, the summer villages of Tâiakwin,
Heshotatsína, and K’iapkwainakwin have been occupied by a few families
during the entire year.</p>

<h4><a name="page139d" id="page139d">CONCLUDING REMARKS.</a></h4>

<p>The task involved in the foregoing classification has been
accomplished by intermittent labors extending through more than twenty
years of time. Many thousand printed vocabularies, embracing numerous
larger lexic and grammatic works, have been studied and compared. In
addition to the printed material, a very large body of manuscript matter
has been used, which is now in the archives of the Bureau of Ethnology,
and which, it is hoped, will ultimately be published. The author does
not desire that his work shall be considered final, but rather as
initiatory and tentative. The task of studying many hundreds of
languages and deriving therefrom ultimate conclusions as contributions
to the science of philology is one of great magnitude, and in its
accomplishment an army of scholars must be employed. The wealth of this
promised harvest appeals strongly to the scholars of America for
systematic and patient labor. The languages are many and greatly diverse
in their characteristics, in grammatic as well as in lexic elements. The
author believes it is safe to affirm that the philosophy of language is
some time to be greatly enriched from this source. From the materials
which have been and may be gathered in this field the evolution of
language can be studied from an early form, wherein words are usually
not parts of speech, to a form where the parts of speech are somewhat
differentiated; and where the growth of gender, number, and case
systems, together with the development of tense and mode systems can be
observed. The evolution of mind in the endeavor to express thought, by
coining, combining, and contracting words and by organizing logical
sentences through the development of parts of speech and
<span class="pagenum">140</span>
<a name="page140" id="page140"> </a>
their syntactic arrangement, is abundantly illustrated. The languages
are very unequally developed in their several parts. Low gender systems
appear with high tense systems, highly evolved case systems with
slightly developed mode systems; and there is scarcely any one of these
languages, so far as they have been studied, which does not exhibit
archaic devices in its grammar.</p>

<p>The author has delayed the present publication somewhat, expecting to
supplement it with another paper on the characteristics of those
languages which have been most fully recorded, but such supplementary
paper has already grown too large for this place and is yet unfinished,
while the necessity for speedy publication of the present results seems
to be imperative. The needs of the Bureau of Ethnology, in directing the
work of the linguists employed in it, and especially in securing and
organizing the labor of a large body of collaborators throughout the
country, call for this publication at the present time.</p>

<p>In arranging the scheme of linguistic families the author has
proceeded very conservatively. Again and again languages have been
thrown together as constituting one family and afterwards have been
separated, while other languages at first deemed unrelated have
ultimately been combined in one stock. Notwithstanding all this care,
there remain a number of doubtful cases. For example, Buschmann has
thrown the Shoshonean and Nahuatlan families into one. Now the
Shoshonean languages are those best known to the author, and with some
of them he has a tolerable speaking acquaintance. The evidence brought
forward by Buschmann and others seems to be doubtful. A part is derived
from jargon words, another part from adventitious similarities, while
some facts seem to give warrant to the conclusion that they should be
considered as one stock, but the author prefers, under the present state
of knowledge, to hold them apart and await further evidence, being
inclined to the opinion that the peoples speaking these languages have
borrowed some part of their vocabularies from one another.</p>

<p>After considering the subject with such materials as are on hand,
this general conclusion has been reached: That borrowed materials exist
in all the languages; and that some of these borrowed materials can be
traced to original sources, while the larger part of such acquisitions
can not be thus relegated to known families. In fact, it is believed
that the existing languages, great in number though they are, give
evidence of a more primitive condition, when a far greater number were
spoken. When there are two or more languages of the same stock, it
appears that this differentiation into diverse tongues is due mainly to
the absorption of other material, and that thus the multiplication of
dialects and languages of the same group furnishes evidence that at some
prior time there existed other languages which are now lost except as
they are partially preserved in the divergent elements of the group. The
conclusion which has been reached, therefore, does
<span class="pagenum">141</span>
<a name="page141" id="page141"> </a>
not accord with the hypothesis upon which the investigation began,
namely, that common elements would be discovered in all these languages,
for the longer the study has proceeded the more clear it has been made
to appear that the grand process of linguistic development among the
tribes of North America has been toward unification rather than toward
multiplication, that is, that the multiplied languages of the same stock
owe their origin very largely to absorbed languages that are lost. The
data upon which this conclusion has been reached can not here be set
forth, but the hope is entertained that the facts already collected may
ultimately be marshaled in such a manner that philologists will be able
to weigh the evidence and estimate it for what it may be worth.</p>

<p>The opinion that the differentiation of languages within a single
stock is mainly due to the absorption of materials from other stocks,
often to the extinguishment of the latter, has grown from year to year
as the investigation has proceeded. Wherever the material has been
sufficient to warrant a conclusion on this subject, no language has been
found to be simple in its origin, but every language has been found to
be composed of diverse elements. The processes of borrowing known in
historic times are those which have been at work in prehistoric times,
and it is not probable that any simple language derived from some single
pristine group of roots can be discovered.</p>

<p>There is an opinion current that the lower languages change with
great rapidity, and that, by reason of this, dialects and languages of
the same stock are speedily differentiated. This widely spread opinion
does not find warrant in the facts discovered in the course of this
research. The author has everywhere been impressed with the fact that
savage tongues are singularly persistent, and that a language which is
dependent for its existence upon oral tradition is not easily modified.
The same words in the same form are repeated from generation to
generation, so that lexic and grammatic elements have a life that
changes very slowly. This is especially true where the habitat of the
tribe is unchanged. Migration introduces a potent agency of mutation,
but a new environment impresses its characteristics upon a language more
by a change in the <ins class="correction"
title="text reads “sematic”">semantic</ins> content or meaning of
words than by change in their forms. There is another agency of change
of profound influence, namely, association with other tongues. When
peoples are absorbed by peaceful or militant agencies new materials are
brought into their language, and the affiliation of such matter seems to
be the chief factor in the differentiation of languages within the same
stock. In the presence of opinions that have slowly grown in this
direction, the author is inclined to think that some of the groups
herein recognized as families will ultimately be divided, as the common
materials of such languages, when they are more thoroughly studied, will
be seen to have been borrowed.</p>

<a name="page142" id="page142"> </a>
In the studies which have been made as preliminary to this paper, I have
had great assistance from Mr. James C. Pilling and Mr. Henry W. Henshaw.
Mr. Pilling began by preparing a list of papers used by me, but his work
has developed until it assumes the proportions of a great bibliographic
research, and already he has published five bibliographies, amounting in
all to about 1,200 pages. He is publishing this bibliographic material
by linguistic families, as classified by myself in this paper. Scholars
in this field of research will find their labors greatly abridged by the
work of Mr. Pilling. Mr. Henshaw began the preparation of the list of
tribes, but his work also has developed into an elaborate system of
research into the synonymy of the North American tribes, and when his
work is published it will constitute a great and valuable contribution
to the subject. The present paper is but a preface to the works of Mr.
Pilling and Mr. Henshaw, and would have been published in form as such
had not their publications assumed such proportions as to preclude it.
And finally, it is needful to say that I could not have found the time
to make this classification, imperfect as it is, except with the aid of
the great labors of the gentlemen mentioned, for they have gathered the
literature and brought it ready to my hand. For the classification
itself, however, I am wholly responsible.</p>

<p>I am also indebted to Mr. Albert S. Gatschet and Mr. J. Owen Dorsey
for the preparation of many comparative lists necessary to my work.</p>

<p>The task of preparing the map accompanying this paper was greatly
facilitated by the previously published map of Gallatin. I am especially
indebted to Col. Garrick Mallery for work done in the early part of its
preparation in this form. I have also received assistance from Messrs.
Gatschet, Dorsey, Mooney and Curtin. The final form which it has taken
is largely due to the labors of Mr. Henshaw, who has gathered many
important facts relating to the habitat of North American tribes while
preparing a synonymy of tribal names.</p>

<h4 class="chapter boldf">THE MIDĒ´WIWIN OR “GRAND MEDICINE
SOCIETY”<br>
OF THE OJIBWAY.</h4>

<hr class="tiny">

<h5 class="smallcaps">By W. J. Hoffman.</h5>

<hr class="tiny">

<h4><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<p>The Ojibwa is one of the largest tribes of the United States, and it
is scattered over a considerable area, from the Province of Ontario, on
the east, to the Red River of the North, on the west, and from Manitoba
southward through the States of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This
tribe is, strictly speaking, a timber people, and in its westward
migration or dispersion has never passed beyond the limit of the timber
growth which so remarkably divides the State of Minnesota into two parts
possessing distinct physical features. The western portion of this State
is a gently undulating prairie which sweeps away to the Rocky Mountains,
while the eastern portion is heavily timbered. The dividing line, at or
near the meridian of 95° 50' west longitude, extends due north and
south, and at a point about 75 miles south of the northern boundary the
timber line trends toward the northwest, crossing the State line, 49°
north latitude, at about 97° 10' west longitude.</p>

<p>Minnesota contains many thousand lakes of various sizes, some of
which are connected by fine water courses, while others are entirely
isolated. The wooded country is undulating, the elevated portions being
covered chiefly with pine, fir, spruce, and other coniferous trees, and
the lowest depressions being occupied by lakes, ponds, or marshes,
around which occur the tamarack, willow, and other trees which thrive in
moist ground, while the regions between these extremes are covered with
oak, poplar, ash, birch, maple, and many other varieties of trees and
shrubs.</p>

<p>Wild fowl, game, and fish are still abundant, and until recently have
furnished to the Indians the chief source of subsistence.</p>

<p>Tribal organization according to the totemic system is practically
broken up, as the Indians are generally located upon or near the several
reservations set apart for them by the General Government, where they
have been under more or less restraint by the United States Indian
agents and the missionaries. Representatives of various totems or gentes
may therefore be found upon a single reservation,
<span class="pagenum">150</span>
<a name="page150" id="page150"> </a>
<!--png 196-->
where they continue to adhere to traditional customs and beliefs, thus
presenting an interesting field for ethnologic research.</p>

<p>The present distribution of the Ojibwa in Minnesota and Wisconsin is
indicated upon the accompanying map, <a href="#plateII">Pl. <span
class="smallroman">II</span></a>. In the southern portion many of
these people have adopted civilized pursuits, but throughout the
northern and northwestern part many bands continue to adhere to their
primitive methods and are commonly designated “wild Indians.” The
habitations of many of the latter are rude and primitive. The bands on
the northeast shore of Red Lake, as well as a few others farther east,
have occupied these isolated sites for an uninterrupted period of about
three centuries, as is affirmed by the chief men of the several villages
and corroborated by other traditional evidence.</p>

<p>Father Claude Alloüez, upon his arrival in 1666 at Shagawaumikong, or
La Pointe, found the Ojibwa preparing to attack the Sioux. The
settlement at this point was an extensive one, and in traditions
pertaining to the “Grand Medicine Society” frequent allusion is made to
the fact that at this place the rites were practiced in their greatest
purity.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren, in his History of the Ojibwa Indians,<a class="tag" name="tag115" id="tag115" href="#note115">115</a> bases his belief upon
traditional evidence that the Ojibwa first had knowledge of the whites
in 1612. Early in the seventeenth century the French missionaries met
with various tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock, as well as with
bands or subtribes of the Ojibwa Indians. One of the latter, inhabiting
the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, is frequently mentioned in the Jesuit
Relations as the Saulteurs. This term was applied to all those people
who lived at the Falls, but from other statements it is clear that the
Ojibwa formed the most important body in that vicinity. La Hontan speaks
of the “Outchepoues, alias Sauteurs,” as good warriors. The name
Saulteur survives at this day and is applied to a division of the
tribe.</p>

<p>According to statements made by numerous Ojibwa chiefs of importance
the tribe began its westward dispersion from La Pointe and Fond du Lac
at least two hundred and fifty years ago, some of the bands penetrating
the swampy country of northern Minnesota, while others went westward and
southwestward. According to a statement<a class="tag" name="tag116" id="tag116" href="#note116">116</a> of the location of the tribes of Lake
Superior, made at Mackinaw in 1736, the Sioux then occupied the southern
and northern extremities of that lake. It is possible, however, that the
northern bands of the Ojibwa may have penetrated the region adjacent to
the Pigeon River and passed west to near their present location, thus
avoiding their enemies who occupied the lake shore south of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">151</span>
<a name="page151" id="page151"> </a>
<!--png 199-->
From recent investigations among a number of tribes of the Algonkian
linguistic division it is found that the traditions and practices
pertaining to the Midē´wiwin, Society of the Midē´ or Shamans, popularly
designated as the “Grand Medicine Society,” prevailed generally, and the
rites are still practiced at irregular intervals, though in slightly
different forms in various localities.</p>

<p>In the reports of early travelers and missionaries no special mention
is made of the Midē´, the Jes´sakkīd´, or the Wâbĕnō´, but the term
sorcerer or juggler is generally employed to designate that class of
persons who professed the power of prophecy, and who practiced
incantation and administered medicinal preparations. Constant reference
is made to the opposition of these personages to the introduction of
Christianity. In the light of recent investigation the cause of this
antagonism is seen to lie in the fact that the traditions of Indian
genesis and cosmogony and the ritual of initiation into the Society of
the Midē´ constitute what is to them a religion, even more powerful and
impressive than the Christian religion is to the average civilized man.
This opposition still exists among the leading classes of a number of
the Algonkian tribes, and especially among the Ojibwa, many bands of
whom have been more or less isolated and beyond convenient reach of the
Church. The purposes of the society are twofold; first, to preserve the
traditions just mentioned, and second, to give a certain class of
ambitious men and women sufficient influence through their acknowledged
power of exorcism and necromancy to lead a comfortable life at the
expense of the credulous. The persons admitted into the society are
firmly believed to possess the power of communing with various
supernatural beings&mdash;manidos&mdash;and in order that certain
desires may be realized they are sought after and consulted. The purpose
of the present paper is to give an account of this society and of the
ceremony of initiation as studied and observed at White Earth,
Minnesota, in 1889. Before proceeding to this, however, it may be of
interest to consider a few statements made by early travelers respecting
the “sorcerers or jugglers” and the methods of medication.</p>

<p>In referring to the practices of the Algonkian tribes of the
Northwest, La Hontan<a class="tag" name="tag117" id="tag117" href="#note117">117</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>When they are sick, they only drink Broth, and eat
sparingly; and if they have the good luck to fall asleep, they think
themselves cur’d: They have told me frequently, that sleeping and
sweating would cure the most stubborn Diseases in the World. When they
are so weak that they cannot get out of Bed, their Relations come and
dance and make merry before ’em, in order to divert ’em. To conclude,
when they are ill, they are always visited by a sort of Quacks,
(<i>Jongleurs</i>); of whom ’t will now be proper to subjoin two or
three Words by the bye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <i>Jongleur</i> is a sort of <i>Physician</i>, or rather a
<i>Quack</i>, who being once cur’d of some dangerous Distemper, has the
Presumption and Folly to fancy that he is immortal, and possessed of the
Power of curing all Diseases, by speaking to the Good and Evil Spirits.
Now though every Body rallies upon these Fellows when
<span class="pagenum">152</span>
<a name="page152" id="page152"> </a>
<!--png 200-->
they are absent, and looks upon ’em as Fools that have lost their Senses
by some violent Distemper, yet they allow ’em to visit the Sick; whether
it be to divert ’em with their Idle Stories, or to have an Opportunity
of seeing them rave, skip about, cry, houl, and make Grimaces and Wry
Faces, as if they were possess’d. When all the Bustle is over, they
demand a Feast of a Stag and some large Trouts for the Company, who are
thus regal’d at once with Diversion and Good Cheer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the Quack comes to visit the Patient, he examines him
very carefully; <i>If the Evil Spirit be here</i>, says he, <i>we shall
quickly dislodge him.</i> This said, he withdraws by himself to a little
Tent made on purpose, where he dances, and sings houling like an Owl;
(which gives the Jesuits Occasion to say, <i>That the Devil converses
with ’em</i>.) After he has made an end of this Quack Jargon, he comes
and rubs the Patient in some part of his Body, and pulling some little
Bones out of his Mouth, acquaints the Patient, <i>That these very Bones
came out of his Body; that he ought to pluck up a good heart, in regard
that his Distemper is but a Trifle; and in fine, that in order to
accelerate the Cure, ’t will be convenient to send his own and his
Relations Slaves to shoot Elks, Deer, &amp;c., to the end they may all
eat of that sort of Meat, upon which his Cure does absolutely
depend.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Commonly these Quacks bring ’em some Juices of Plants, which
are a sort of Purges, and are called <i>Maskikik</i>.</blockquote>

<p>Hennepin, in “A Continuation of the New Discovery,” etc.,<a class="tag" name="tag118" id="tag118" href="#note118">118</a> speaks of the
religion and sorcerers of the tribes of the St. Lawrence and those
living about the Great Lakes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We have been all too sadly convinced, that almost all the
Salvages in general have no notion of a God, and that they are not able
to comprehend the most ordinary Arguments on that Subject; others will
have a Spirit that commands, say they, in the Air. Some among ’em look
upon the Skie as a kind of Divinity; others as an <i>Otkon</i> or
<i>Manitou</i>, either Good or Evil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These People admit of some sort of Genius in all things;
they all believe there is a Master of Life, as they call him, but hereof
they make various applications; some of them have a lean Raven, which
they carry always along with them, and which they say is the Master of
their Life; others have an Owl, and some again a Bone, a Sea-Shell, or
some such thing;</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no Nation among ’em which has not a sort of Juglers
or Conjuerers, which some look upon to be Wizards, but in my Opinion
there is no Great reason to believe ’em such, or to think that their
Practice favours any thing of a Communication with the
Devil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These Impostors cause themselves to be reverenced as
Prophets which fore-tell Futurity. They will needs be look’d upon to
have an unlimited Power. They boast of being able to make it Wet or Dry;
to cause a Calm or a Storm; to render Land Fruitful or Barren; and, in a
Word to make Hunters Fortunate or Unfortunate. They also pretend to
Physick, and to apply Medicines, but which are such, for the most part
as have little Virtue at all in ’em, especially to Cure that Distemper
which they pretend&nbsp;to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is impossible to imagine, the horrible Howlings and
strange Contortions that those Jugglers make of their Bodies, when they
are disposing themselves to Conjure, or raise their
Enchantments.</blockquote>

<p>Marquette, who visited the Miami, Mascontin and Kickapoo Indians in
1673, after referring to the Indian herbalist, mentions also the
ceremony of the “calumet dance,” as follows:</p>

<blockquote>They have Physicians amongst them, towards whom they are
very liberal when they are sick, thinking that the Operation of the
Remedies they take, is proportional to the Presents they make unto those
who have prescrib’d them.</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">153</span>
<a name="page153" id="page153"> </a>
<!--png 201-->
In connection with this, reference is made by Marquette to a certain
class of individuals among the Illinois and Dakota, who were compelled
to wear women’s clothes, and who were debarred many privileges, but were
permitted to “assist at all the Superstitions of their <i>Juglers</i>,
and their solemn Dances in honor of the <i>Calumet</i>, in which they
may sing, but it is not lawful for them to dance. They are call’d to
their Councils, and nothing is determin’d without their Advice; for,
because of their extraordinary way of Living, they are look’d upon as
<i>Manitous</i>, or at least for great and incomparable Genius’s.”</p>

<p>That the calumet was brought into requisition upon all occasions of
interest is learned from the following statement, in which the same
writer declares that it is “the most mysterious thing in the World. The
Sceptres of our Kings are not so much respected; for the Savages have
such a Deference for this Pipe, that one may call it <i>The God of Peace
and War, and the Arbiter of Life and Death</i>. Their <i>Calumet of
Peace</i> is different from the <i>Calumet of War</i>; They make use of
the former to seal their Alliances and Treaties, to travel with safety,
and receive Strangers; and the other is to proclaim War.”</p>

<p>This reverence for the calumet is shown by the manner in which it is
used at dances, in the ceremony of smoking, etc., indicating a religious
devoutness approaching that recently observed among various Algonkian
tribes in connection with the ceremonies of the Midē´wiwin. When the
calumet dance was held, the Illinois appear to have resorted to the
houses in the winter and to the groves in the summer. The above-named
authority continues in this connection:</p>

<blockquote>They chuse for that purpose a set Place among Trees, to
shelter themselves against the Heat of the Sun, and lay in the middle a
large Matt, as a Carpet, to lay upon the God of the Chief of the
Company, who gave the Ball; for every one has his peculiar God, whom
they call <i>Manitoa</i>. It is sometime a Stone, a Bird, a Serpent, or
anything else that they dream of in their Sleep; for they think this
<i>Manitoa</i> will prosper their Wants, as Fishing, Hunting, and other
Enterprizes. To the Right of their <i>Manitoa</i> they place the
<i>Calumet</i>, their Great Deity, making round about it a Kind of
Trophy with their Arms, viz. their Clubs, Axes, Bows, Quivers, and
Arrows.<span class="pad1"> ***</span>Every Body sits down afterwards,
round about, as they come, having first of all saluted the
<i>Manitoa</i>, which they do in blowing the Smoak of their Tobacco upon
it, which is as much as offering to it Frankincense.<span class="pad1"> ***</span>This <i>Preludium</i> being over, he who is to begin
the Dance appears in the middle of the Assembly, and having taken the
<i>Calumet</i>, presents it to the Sun, as if he wou’d invite him to
smoke. Then he moves it into an infinite Number of Postures sometimes
laying it near the Ground, then stretching its Wings, as if he wou’d
make it fly, and then presents it to the Spectators, who smoke with it
one after another, dancing all the while. This is the first Scene of
this famous Ball.</blockquote>

<p>The infinite number of postures assumed in offering the pipe appear
as significant as the “smoke ceremonies” mentioned in connection with
the preparatory instruction of the candidate previous to his initiation
into the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">154</span>
<a name="page154" id="page154"> </a>
<!--png 202-->
In his remarks on the religion of the Indians and the practices of the
sorcerers, Hennepin says:</p>

<blockquote>As for their Opinion concerning the Earth, they make use of
a Name of a certain <i>Genius</i>, whom they call <i>Micaboche</i>, who
has cover’d the whole Earth with water (as they imagine) and relate
innumerable fabulous Tales, some of which have a kind of Analogy with
the Universal Deluge. These Barbarians believe that there are certain
Spirits in the Air, between Heaven and Earth, who have a power to
foretell future Events, and others who play the part of Physicians,
curing all sorts of Distempers. Upon which account, it happens, that
these <i>Savages</i> are very Superstitious, and consult their Oracles
with a great deal of exactness. One of these Masters-Jugglers who pass
for Sorcerers among them, one day caus’d a Hut to be erected with ten
thick Stakes, which he fix’d very deep in the Ground, and then made a
horrible noise to Consult the Spirits, to know whether abundance of Snow
wou’d fall ere long, that they might have good game in the Hunting of
Elks and Beavers: Afterward he bawl’d out aloud from the bottom of the
Hut, that he saw many Herds of Elks, which were as yet at a very great
distance, but that they drew near within seven or eight Leagues of their
Huts, which caus’d a great deal of joy among those poor deluded
Wretches.</blockquote>

<p>That this statement refers to one or more tribes of the Algonkian
linguistic stock is evident, not only because of the reference to the
sorcerers and their peculiar methods of procedure, but also that the
name of <i>Micaboche</i>, an Algonkian divinity, appears. This Spirit,
who acted as an intercessor between Ki´tshi Man´idō (Great Spirit) and
the Indians, is known among the Ojibwa as Mi´nabō´zho; but to this full
reference will be made further on in connection with the Myth of the
origin of the Midē´wiwin. The tradition of Nokomis (the earth) and the
birth of Manabush (the Mi´nabō´zho of the Menomoni) and his brother, the
Wolf, that pertaining to the re-creation of the world, and fragments of
other myths, are thrown together and in a mangled form presented by
Hennepin in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>Some Salvages which live at the upper end of the River St.
<i>Lawrence</i>, do relate a pretty diverting Story. They hold almost
the same opinion with the former [the Iroquois], that a Woman came down
from Heaven, and remained for some while fluttering in the Air, not
finding Ground whereupon to put her Foot. But that the Fishes moved with
Compassion for her, immediately held a Consultation to deliberate which
of them should receive her. The Tortoise very officiously offered its
Back on the Surface of the Water. The Woman came to rest upon it, and
fixed herself there. Afterwards the Filthiness and Dirt of the Sea
gathering together about the Tortoise, there was formed by little and
little that vast Tract of Land, which we now call
<i>America</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They add that this Woman grew weary of her Solitude, wanting
some body for to keep her Company, that so she might spend her time more
pleasantly. Melancholy and Sadness having seiz’d upon her Spirits, she
fell asleep, and a Spirit descended from above, and finding her in that
Condition approach’d and knew her unperceptibly. From which Approach she
conceived two Children, which came forth out of one of her Ribs. But
these two Brothers could never afterwards agree together. One of them
was a better Huntsman than the other; they quarreled every day; and
their Disputes grew so high at last, that one could not bear with the
other. One especially being of a very wild Temper, hated mortally his
Brother who was of a milder Constitution, who being no longer able to
endure the Pranks of the other,
<span class="pagenum">155</span>

he resolved at last to part from him. He retired then into Heaven,
whence, for a Mark of his just Resentment, he causeth at several times
his Thunder to rore over the Head of his unfortunate
Brother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime after the Spirit descended again on that Woman, and
she conceived a Daughter, from whom (as the Salvages say) were
propagated these numerous People, which do occupy now one of the
greatest parts of the Universe.</blockquote>

<p>It is evident that the narrator has sufficiently distorted the
traditions to make them conform, as much as practicable, to the biblical
story of the birth of Christ. No reference whatever is made in the
Ojibwa or Menomoni myths to the conception of the Daughter of Nokomis
(the earth) by a celestial visitant, but the reference is to one of the
wind gods. Mi´nabō´zho became angered with the Ki´tshi Man´idō, and the
latter, to appease his discontent, gave to Mi´nabō´zho the rite of the
Midēwiwin. The brother of Mi´nabō´zho was destroyed by the malevolent
underground spirits and now rules the abode of shadows,&mdash;the “Land
of the Midnight Sun.”</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the “Bay of Puans” (Green Bay, Wisconsin),
Marquette found a village inhabited by three nations, viz: “Miamis,
Maskoutens, and Kikabeux.” He says:</p>

<blockquote>When I arriv’d there, I was very glad to see a great Cross
set up in the middle of the Village, adorn’d with several White Skins,
Red Girdles, Bows and Arrows, which that good People had offer’d to the
Great <i>Manitou</i>, to return him their Thanks for the care he had
taken of them during the Winter, and that he had granted them a
prosperous Hunting. <i>Manitou</i>, is the Name they give in general to
all Spirits whom they think to be above the Nature of Man.</blockquote>

<p>Marquette was without doubt ignorant of the fact that the cross is
the sacred post, and the symbol of the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin,
as will be fully explained in connection with that grade of the society.
The erroneous conclusion that the cross was erected as an evidence of
the adoption of Christianity, and possibly as a compliment to the
visitor, was a natural one on the part of the priest, but this same
symbol of the Midē´ Society had probably been erected and bedecked with
barbaric emblems and weapons months before anything was known of
him.</p>

<p>The result of personal investigations among the Ojibwa, conducted
during the years 1887, 1888 and 1889, are presented in the accompanying
paper. The information was obtained from a number of the chief Midē´
priests living at Red Lake and White Earth reservations, as well as from
members of the society from other reservations, who visited the last
named locality during the three years. Special mention of the
peculiarity of the music recorded will be made at the proper place; and
it may here be said that in no instance was the use of colors detected,
in any birch-bark or other records or mnemonic songs, simply to heighten
the artistic effect; though the reader would be led by an examination of
the works of Schoolcraft to believe this to be a common practice. Col.

Society of

Washington, District of Columbia, in 1888, says, regarding this
subject:</p>

<blockquote>The general character of his voluminous publications has not
been such as to assure modern critics of his accuracy, and the wonderful
minuteness, as well as comprehension, attributed by him to the Ojibwa
hieroglyphs has been generally regarded of late with suspicion. It was
considered in the Bureau of Ethnology an important duty to ascertain how
much of truth existed in these remarkable accounts, and for that purpose
its pictographic specialists, myself and Dr. W.&nbsp;J. Hoffman as
assistant, were last summer directed to proceed to the most favorable
points in the present habitat of the tribe, namely, the northern region
of Minnesota and Wisconsin, to ascertain how much was yet to be
discovered.<span class="pad1"> ***</span>The general results of the
comparison of Schoolcraft’s statements with what is now found shows
that, in substance, he told the truth, but with much exaggeration and
coloring. The word “coloring” is particularly appropriate, because, in
his copious illustrations, various colors were used freely with apparent
significance, whereas, in fact, the general rule in regard to the
birch-bark rolls was that they were never colored at all; indeed, the
bark was not adapted to coloration. The metaphorical coloring was also
used by him in a manner which, to any thorough student of the Indian
philosophy and religion, seems absurd. Metaphysical expressions are
attached to some of the devices, or, as he calls them, symbols, which,
could never have been entertained by a people in the stage of culture of
the Ojibwa.</blockquote>


<h4 class="section"><a name="shamans" id="shamans">SHAMANS.</a></h4>

<p>There are extant among the Ojibwa Indians three classes of mystery
men, termed respectively and in order of importance the Midē´, the
Jĕs´sakkīd´, and the Wâbĕnō´, but before proceeding to elaborate in
detail the Society of the Midē´, known as the Midē´wiwin, a brief
description of the last two is necessary.</p>

<p>The term Wâbĕnō´ has been explained by various intelligent Indians as
signifying “Men of the dawn,” “Eastern men,” etc. Their profession is
not thoroughly understood, and their number is so extremely limited that
but little information respecting them can be obtained. Schoolcraft,<a class="tag" name="tag119" id="tag119" href="#note119">119</a> in
referring to the several classes of Shamans, says “there is a third form
or rather modification of the medawin,<span class="pad1">
***</span>the Wâbĕnō´; a term denoting a kind of midnight orgies, which
is regarded as a corruption of the Meda.” This writer furthermore
remarks<a class="tag" name="tag120" id="tag120" href="#note120">120</a>
that “it is stated by judicious persons among themselves to be of modern
origin. They regard it as a degraded form of the mysteries of the
Meda.”</p>

<p>From personal investigation it has been ascertained that a Wâbĕnō´
does not affiliate with others of his class so as to constitute a
society, but indulges his pretensions individually. A Wâbĕnō´ is
primarily prompted by dreams or visions which may occur during his
youth, for which purpose he leaves his village to fast for an indefinite
number of days. It is positively affirmed that evil man´idōs favor his
desires,
<span class="pagenum">157</span>
<a name="page157" id="page157"> </a>
<!--png 205-->
and apart from his general routine of furnishing “hunting medicine,”
“love powders,” etc., he pretends also to practice medical magic. When a
hunter has been successful through the supposed assistance of the
Wâbĕnō´, he supplies the latter with part of the game, when, in giving a
feast to his tutelary daimon, the Wâbĕnō´ will invite a number of
friends, but all who desire to come are welcome. This feast is given at
night; singing and dancing are boisterously indulged in, and the
Wâbĕnō´, to sustain his reputation, entertains his visitors with a
further exhibition of his skill. By the use of plants he is alleged to
be enabled to take up and handle with impunity red-hot stones and
burning brands, and without evincing the slightest discomfort it is said
that he will bathe his hands in boiling water, or even boiling maple
sirup. On account of such performances the general impression prevails
among the Indians that the Wâbĕnō´ is a “dealer in fire,” or
“fire-handler.” Such exhibitions always terminate at the approach of
day. The number of these pretenders who are not members of the
Midē´wiwin, is very limited; for instance, there are at present but two
or three at White Earth Reservation and none at Leech Lake.</p>

<p>As a general rule, however, the Wâbĕnō´ will seek entrance into the
Midē´wiwin when he becomes more of a specialist in the practice of
medical magic, incantations, and the exorcism of malevolent man´idōs,
especially such as cause disease.</p>

<p>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ is a seer and prophet; though commonly designated a
“juggler,” the Indians define him as a “revealer of hidden truths.”
There is no association whatever between the members of this profession,
and each practices his art singly and alone whenever a demand is made
and the fee presented. As there is no association, so there is no
initiation by means of which one may become a Jĕs´sakkīd´. The gift is
believed to be given by the thunder god, or Animiki´, and then only at
long intervals and to a chosen few. The gift is received during youth,
when the fast is undertaken and when visions appear to the individual.
His renown depends upon his own audacity and the opinion of the tribe.
He is said to possess the power to look into futurity; to become
acquainted with the affairs and intentions of men; to prognosticate the
success or misfortune of hunters and warriors, as well as other affairs
of various individuals, and to call from any living human being the
soul, or, more strictly speaking, the shadow, thus depriving the victim
of reason, and even of life. His power consists in invoking, and causing
evil, while that of the Midē´ is to avert it; he attempts at times to
injure the Midē´ but the latter, by the aid of his superior man´idos,
becomes aware of, and averts such premeditated injury. It sometimes
happens that the demon possessing a patient is discovered, but the Midē´
alone has the power to expel him. The exorcism of demons is one of the
chief pretensions of this personage, and evil spirits are sometimes
removed
<span class="pagenum">158</span>
<a name="page158" id="page158"> </a>
<!--png 206-->
by sucking them through tubes, and startling tales are told how the
Jĕs´sakkīd´ can, in the twinkling of an eye, disengage himself of the
most complicated tying of cords and ropes, etc. The lodge used by this
class of men consists of four poles planted in the ground, forming a
square of three or four feet and upward in diameter, around which are
wrapped birch bark, robes, or canvas in such a way as to form an upright
cylinder. Communion is held with the turtle, who is the most powerful
man´idō of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and through him, with numerous other
malevolent man´idōs, especially the Animiki´, or thunder-bird. When the
prophet has seated himself within his lodge the structure begins to sway
violently from side to side, loud thumping noises are heard within,
denoting the arrival of man´idōs, and numerous voices and laughter are
distinctly audible to those without. Questions may then be put to the
prophet and, if everything be favorable, the response is not long in
coming. In his notice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, Schoolcraft affirms<a class="tag" name="tag121" id="tag121" href="#note121">121</a> that “while he
thus exercises the functions of a prophet, he is also a member of the
highest class of the fraternity of the Midâwin&mdash;a society of men
who exercise the medical art on the principles of magic and
incantations<ins class="correction" title="close quote missing">.”</ins>
The fact is that there is not the slightest connection
between the practice of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and that of the Midē´wiwin, and
it is seldom, if at all, that a Midē´ becomes a Jĕs´sakkīd´, although
the latter sometimes gains admission into the Midē´wiwin, chiefly with
the intention of strengthening his power with his tribe.</p>

<p>The number of individuals of this class who are not members of the
Midē´wiwin is limited, though greater than that of the Wâbĕnō´. An idea
of the proportion of numbers of the respective classes may be formed by
taking the case of Menomoni Indians, who are in this respect upon the
same plane as the Ojibwa. That tribe numbers about fifteen hundred, the
Midē´ Society consisting, in round numbers, of one hundred members, and
among the entire population there are but two Wâbĕnō´ and five
Jĕs´sakkīd´.</p>

<p>It is evident that neither the Wâbĕnō´ nor the Jĕs´sakkīd´ confine
themselves to the mnemonic songs which are employed during their
ceremonial performances, or even prepare them to any extent. Such bark
records as have been observed or recorded, even after most careful
research and examination extending over the field seasons of three
years, prove to have been the property of Wâbĕnō´ and Jĕs´sakkīd´, who
were also Midē´. It is probable that those who practice either of the
first two forms of ceremonies and nothing else are familiar with and may
employ for their own information certain mnemonic records; but they are
limited to the characteristic formulæ of exorcism, as their practice
varies and is subject to changes according to circumstances and the
requirements and wants of the applicant when words are chanted to accord
therewith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">159</span>
<a name="page159" id="page159"> </a>
<!--png 207-->
Some examples of songs used by Jĕs´sakkīd´, after they have become
Midē´, will be given in the description of the several degrees of the
Midē ’wiwin.</p>

<p>There is still another class of persons termed Mashkī´kĭkē´winĭnĭ, or
herbalists, who are generally denominated “medicine men,” as the Ojibwa
word implies. Their calling is a simple one, and consists in knowing the
mysterious properties of a variety of plants, herbs, roots, and berries,
which are revealed upon application and for a fee. When there is an
administration of a remedy for a given complaint, based upon true
scientific principles, it is only in consequence of such practice having
been acquired from the whites, as it has usually been the custom of the
Catholic Fathers to utilize all ordinary and available remedies for the
treatment of the common disorders of life. Although these herbalists are
aware that certain plants or roots will produce a specified effect upon
the human system, they attribute the benefit to the fact that such
remedies are distasteful and injurious to the demons who are present in
the system and to whom the disease is attributed. Many of these
herbalists are found among women, also; and these, too, are generally
members of the Midē´wiwin. In <a href="#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> is shown
an herbalist preparing a mixture.</p>

The origin of the Midē´wiwin or Midē´ Society, commonly, though
erroneously, termed Grand Medicine Society, is buried in obscurity. In
the Jesuit Relations, as early as 1642, frequent reference is made to
sorcerers, jugglers, and persons whose faith, influence, and practices
are dependent upon the assistance of “Manitous,” or mysterious spirits;
though, as there is no discrimination made between these different
professors of magic, it is difficult positively to determine which of
the several classes were met with at that early day. It is probable that
the Jĕs´sakkīd´, or juggler, and the Midē´, or Shaman, were
referred&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>The Midē´, in the true sense of the word, is a Shaman, though he has
by various authors been termed powwow, medicine man, priest, seer,
prophet, etc. Among the Ojibwa the office is not hereditary; but among
the Menomoni a curious custom exists, by which some one is selected to
fill the vacancy one year after the death of a Shaman. Whether a similar
practice prevailed among other tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock
can be ascertained only by similar research among the tribes
constituting that stock.</p>

<p>Among the Ojibwa, however, a substitute is sometimes taken to fill
the place of one who has been prepared to receive the first degree of
the Midē´wiwin, or Society of the Midē´, but who is removed by death
before the proper initiation has been conferred. This occurs when a
young man dies, in which case his father or mother may be accepted as a
substitute. This will be explained in more detail under the caption of
Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân or “Ghost Lodge,” a collateral branch of the
Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>As I shall have occasion to refer to the work of the late Mr.
W.&nbsp;W. Warren, a few words respecting him will not be inappropriate.
Mr. Warren was an Ojibwa mixed blood, of good education, and later a
member of the legislature of Minnesota. His work, entiled “History of
the Ojibwa Nation,” was published in Vol. <span class="smallroman">V</span> of the Collections of the Minnesota Historical
Society, St. Paul, 1885, and edited by Dr. E.&nbsp;D. Neill. Mr.
Warren’s work is the result of the labor of a lifetime among his own
people, and, had he lived, he would undoubtedly have added much to the
historical material of which the printed volume chiefly consists. His
manuscript was completed about the year 1852, and he died the following
year. In speaking of the Society of the Midē´,<a class="tag" name="tag122" id="tag122" href="#note122">122</a> he says:</p>

<blockquote>The grand rite of Me-da-we-win (or, as we have learned to
term it, “Grand Medicine<ins class="correction" title="close parenthesis missing">,”)</ins>and
the beliefs incorporated therein, are
not yet fully understood by the whites. This important custom is still
shrouded in mystery even to my own eyes, though I have taken much pains
to inquire and made use of every advantage possessed by speaking their
language perfectly, being related to them, possessing their friendship
and intimate confidence has given me, and yet I frankly acknowledge that
I stand as yet, as it were, on the threshold of the Me-da-we lodge. I
believe, however, that I have obtained full as much and more general and
true information
<span class="pagenum">161</span>
<a name="page161" id="page161"> </a>
<!--png 209-->
on this matter than any other person who has written on the subject, not
excepting a great and standard author, who, to the surprise of many who
know the Ojibways well, has boldly asserted in one of his works that he
has been regularly initiated into the mysteries of this rite, and is a
member of the Me-da-we Society. This is certainly an assertion hard to
believe in the Indian country; and when the old initiators or Indian
priests are told of it they shake their heads in incredulity that a
white man should ever have been allowed <i>in truth</i> to become a
member of their Me-da-we lodge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An entrance into the lodge itself, while the ceremonies are
being enacted, has sometimes been granted through courtesy; though this
does not initiate a person into the mysteries of the creed, nor does it
make him a member of the Society.</blockquote>

<p>These remarks pertaining to the pretensions of “a great and standard
authority” have reference to Mr. Schoolcraft, who among numerous other
assertions makes the following, in the first volume of his Information
Respecting the Indian Tribes of the United States, Philadelphia, 1851,
p. 361, viz:</p>

<blockquote>I had observed the exhibitions of the Medawin, and the
exactness and studious ceremony with which its rites were performed in
1820 in the region of Lake Superior; and determined to avail myself of
the advantages of my official position, in 1822, when I returned as a
Government agent for the tribes, to make further inquiries into its
principles and mode of proceeding. And for this purpose I had its
ceremonies repeated in my office, under the secrecy of closed doors,
with every means of both correct interpretation and of recording the
result. Prior to this transaction I had observed in the hands of an
Indian of the Odjibwa tribe one of those symbolic tablets of pictorial
notation which have been sometimes called “music boards,” from the fact
of their devices being sung off by the initiated of the Meda Society.
This constituted the object of the explanations, which, in accordance
with the positive requisitions of the leader of the society and three
other initiates, was thus ceremoniously made.</blockquote>

<p>This statement is followed by another,<a class="tag" name="tag123" id="tag123" href="#note123">123</a> in which Mr. Schoolcraft, in a
foot-note, affirms:</p>

<blockquote>Having in 1823 been myself admitted to the class of a Meda
by the Chippewas, and taken the initiatory step of a <span class="smallcaps">Sagima</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Jesukaid</span>
in each of the other fraternities, and studied their pictographic system
with great care and good helps, I may speak with the more decision on
the subject.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Schoolcraft presents a superficial outline of the initiatory
ceremonies as conducted during his time, but as the description is
meager, notwithstanding that there is every evidence that the ceremonies
were conducted with more completeness and elaborate dramatization nearly
three-quarters of a century ago than at the present day, I shall not
burden this paper with useless repetition, but present the subject as
conducted within the last three years.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren truly says:</p>

<blockquote>In the Me-da-we rite is incorporated most that is ancient
amongst them&mdash;songs and traditions that have descended not orally,
but in hieroglyphs, for at least a long time of generations. In this
rite is also perpetuated the purest and most ancient idioms of their
language, which differs somewhat from that of the common everyday
use.</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">162</span>
<a name="page162" id="page162"> </a>
<!--png 210-->
As the ritual of the Midē´wiwin is based to a considerable extent upon
traditions pertaining to the cosmogony and genesis and to the thoughtful
consideration by the Good Spirit for the Indian, it is looked upon by
them as “their religion,” as they themselves designate&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>In referring to the rapid changes occurring among many of the Western
tribes of Indians, and the gradual discontinuance of aboriginal
ceremonies and customs, Mr. Warren remarks<a class="tag" name="tag124" id="tag124" href="#note124">124</a> in reference to the
Ojibwa:</p>

<blockquote>Even among these a change is so rapidly taking place, caused
by a close contact with the white race, that ten years hence it will be
too late to save the traditions of their forefathers from total
oblivion. And even now it is with great difficulty that genuine
information can be obtained of them. Their aged men are fast falling
into their graves, and they carry with them the records of the past
history of their people; they are the initiators of the grand rite of
religious belief which they believe the Great Spirit has granted to his
red children to secure them long life on earth and life hereafter; and
in the bosoms of these old men are locked up the original secrets of
this their most ancient belief.<span class="pad1">
***</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>They fully believe, and it forms part of their religion,
that the world has once been covered by a deluge, and that we are now
living on what they term the “new earth.” This idea is fully accounted
for by their vague traditions; and in their Me-da-we-win or religion,
hieroglyphs are used to denote this second earth.</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore,</p>

<blockquote>They fully believe that the red man mortally angered the
Great Spirit which caused the deluge, and at the commencement of the new
earth it was only through the medium and intercession of a powerful
being, whom they denominate Manab-o-sho, that they were allowed to
exist, and means were given them whereby to subsist and support life;
and a code of religion was more lately bestowed on them, whereby they
could commune with the offended Great Spirit, and ward off the approach
and ravages of death.</blockquote>

<p>It may be appropriate in this connection to present the description
given by Rev. Peter Jones of the Midē´ priests and priestesses. Mr.
Jones was an educated Ojibwa Episcopal clergyman, and a member of the
Missasauga&mdash;i.e., the Eagle totemic division of that tribe of
Indians living in Canada. In his work<a class="tag" name="tag125" id="tag125" href="#note125">125</a> he states:</p>

<blockquote>Each tribe has its medicine men and women&mdash;an order of
priesthood consulted and employed in all times of sickness. These
powwows are persons who are believed to have performed extraordinary
cures, either by the application of roots and herbs or by incantations.
When an Indian wishes to be initiated into the order of a powwow, in the
first place he pays a large fee to the faculty. He is then taken into
the woods, where he is taught the names and virtues of the various
useful plants; next he is instructed how to chant the medicine song, and
how to pray, which prayer is a vain repetition offered up to the Master
of Life, or to some munedoo whom the afflicted imagine they have
offended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The powwows are held in high veneration by their deluded
brethren; not so much for their knowledge of medicine as for the magical
power which they are supposed to possess. It is for their interest to
lead these credulous people to believe that they can at pleasure hold
intercourse with the munedoos, who are ever ready to give them whatever
information they require.</blockquote>

The Ojibwa believe in a multiplicity of spirits, or man´idōs, which
inhabit all space and every conspicuous object in nature. These
man´idōs, in turn, are subservient to superior ones, either of a
charitable and benevolent character or those which are malignant and
aggressive. The chief or superior man´idō is termed Ki´tshi
Man´idō&mdash;Great Spirit&mdash;approaching to a great extent the idea
of the God of the Christian religion; the second in their estimation is
Dzhe Man´idō, a benign being upon whom they look as the guardian spirit
of the Midē´wiwin and through whose divine provision the sacred rites of
the Midē´wiwin were granted to man. The Ani´miki or Thunder God is, if
not the supreme, at least one of the greatest of the malignant man´idōs,
and it is from him that the Jĕs´sakkīd´ are believed to obtain their
powers of evil doing. There is one other, to whom special reference will
be made, who abides in and rules the “place of shadows,” the hereafter;
he is known as Dzhibai´ Man´idō&mdash;Shadow Spirit, or more commonly
Ghost Spirit. The name of Ki´tshi Man´idō is never mentioned but with
reverence, and thus only in connection with the rite of Midē´wiwin, or a
sacred feast, and always after making an offering of tobacco.</p>

<p>The first important event in the life of an Ojibwa youth is his first
fast. For this purpose he will leave his home for some secluded spot in
the forest where he will continue to fast for an indefinite number of
days; when reduced by abstinence from food he enters a hysterical or
ecstatic state in which he may have visions and hallucinations. The
spirits which the Ojibwa most desire to see in these dreams are those of
mammals and birds, though any object, whether animate or inanimate, is
considered a good omen. The object which first appears is adopted as the
personal mystery, guardian spirit, or tutelary daimon of the entranced,
and is never mentioned by him without first making a sacrifice. A small
effigy of this man´idō is made, or its outline drawn upon a small piece
of birch bark, which is carried suspended by a string around the neck,
or if the wearer be a Midē´ he carries it in his “medicine bag” or
pinji´gosân. The future course of life of the faster is governed by his
dream; and it sometimes occurs that because of giving an imaginary
importance to the occurrence, such as beholding, during the trance some
powerful man´idō or other object held in great reverence by the members
of the Midē´ Society, the faster first becomes impressed with the idea
of becoming a Midē´. Thereupon he makes application to a prominent Midē´
priest, and seeks his advice as to the necessary course to be pursued to
attain his desire. If the Midē´ priest considers with favor the
application, he consults with his confrères and action is taken, and the
questions of the requisite preliminary instructions, fees, and presents,
etc., are formally discussed. If the Midē´ priests are in accord with
the desires of the applicant an instructor or preceptor is designated,
to whom he must present himself
<span class="pagenum">164</span>
<a name="page164" id="page164"> </a>
<!--png 212-->
and make an agreement as to the amount of preparatory information to be
acquired and the fees and other presents to be given in return. These
fees have nothing whatever to do with the presents which must be
presented to the Midē´ priests previous to his initiation as a member of
the society, the latter being collected during the time that is devoted
to preliminary instruction, which period usually extends over several
years. Thus ample time is found for hunting, as skins and peltries, of
which those not required as presents may be exchanged for blankets,
tobacco, kettles, guns, etc., obtainable from the trader. Sometimes a
number of years are spent in preparation for the first degree of the
Midē´wiwin, and there are many who have impoverished themselves in the
payment of fees and the preparation for the feast to which all visiting
priests are also invited.</p>

<p>Should an Indian who is not prompted by a dream wish to join the
society he expresses to the four chief officiating priests a desire to
purchase a mī´gis, which is the sacred symbol of the society and
consists of a small white shell, to which reference will be made further
on. His application follows the same course as in the preceding
instance, and the same course is pursued also when a Jĕs´sakkīd´ or a
Wâbĕnō´ wishes to become a Midē´.</p>


<h4 class="section"><a name="midewiwin" id="midewiwin">MIDĒ´WIWIN.</a></h4>

<p>The Midē´wiwin&mdash;Society of the Midē´ or Shamans&mdash;consists
of an indefinite number of Midē´ of both sexes. The society is graded
into four separate and distinct degrees, although there is a general
impression prevailing even among certain members that any degree beyond
the first is practically a mere repetition. The greater power attained
by one in making advancement depends upon the fact of his having
submitted to “being shot at with the medicine sacks” in the hands of the
officiating priests. This may be the case at this late day in certain
localities, but from personal experience it has been learned that there
is considerable variation in the dramatization of the ritual. One
circumstance presents itself forcibly to the careful observer, and that
is that the greater number of repetitions of the phrases chanted by the
Midē´ the greater is felt to be the amount of inspiration and power of
the performance. This is true also of some of the lectures in which
reiteration and prolongation in time of delivery aids very much in
forcibly impressing the candidate and other observers with the
importance and sacredness of the ceremony.</p>

<p>It has always been customary for the Midē´ priests to preserve
birch-bark records, bearing delicate incised lines to represent
pictorially the ground plan of the number of degrees to which the owner
is entitled. Such records or charts are sacred and are never exposed to
the public view, being brought forward for inspection only when
<span class="pagenum">165</span>

an accepted candidate has paid his fee, and then only after necessary
preparation by fasting and offerings of tobacco.</p>

Plate III. Red Lake And Leech Lake Records (<i>key</i>).</p>

<p class="link"><a href="images/plates/plateiii.png" target="_blank">Complete Plate</a></p>

<p>During the year 1887, while at Red Lake, Minnesota, I had the good
fortune to discover the existence of an old birch-bark chart, which,
according to the assurances of the chief and assistant Midē´ priests,
had never before been exhibited to a white man, nor even to an Indian
unless he had become a regular candidate. This chart measures 7 feet 1½
inches in length and 18 inches in width, and is made of five pieces of
birch bark neatly and securely stitched together by means of thin, flat
strands of bass wood. At each end are two thin strips of wood, secured
transversely by wrapping and stitching with thin strands of bark, so as
to prevent splitting and fraying of the ends of the record. <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>, is a
reproduction of the design referred&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>It had been in the keeping of Skwēkŏ´mĭk, to whom it was intrusted at
the death of his father-in-law, the latter, in turn, having received it
in 1825 from Badâ´san, the Grand Shaman and chief of the Winnibē´goshish
Ojibwa.</p>

<p>It is affirmed that Badâ´san had received the original from the Grand
Midē´ priest at La Pointe, Wisconsin, where, it is said, the <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘Midê´wiwin’">Midē´wiwin</ins> was at
that time held annually and the ceremonies conducted in strict
accordance with ancient and traditional usage.</p>

<p>The present owner of this record has for many years used it in the
preliminary instruction of candidates. Its value in this respect is very
great, as it presents to the Indian a pictorial résumé of the
traditional history of the origin of the Midē´wiwin, the positions
occupied by the various guardian man´idos in the several degrees, and
the order of procedure in study and progress of the candidate. On
account of the isolation of the Red Lake Indians and their long
continued, independent ceremonial observances, changes have gradually
occurred so that there is considerable variation, both in the pictorial
representation and the initiation, as compared with the records and
ceremonials preserved at other reservations. The reason of this has
already been given.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the above mentioned record, will be
presented further on in connection with two interesting variants which
were subsequently obtained at White Earth, Minnesota. On account of the
widely separated location of many of the different bands of the Ojibwa,
and the establishment of independent Midē´ societies, portions of the
ritual which have been forgotten by one set may be found to survive at
some other locality, though at the expense of some other fragments of
tradition or ceremonial. No satisfactory account of the tradition of the
origin of the Indians has been obtained, but such information as it was
possible to procure will be submitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">166</span>

In all of their traditions pertaining to the early history of the tribe
these people are termed A-nish´-in-â´-bēg&mdash;original people&mdash;a
term surviving also among the Ottawa, Patawatomi, and Menomoni,
indicating that the tradition of their westward migration was extant
prior to the final separation of these tribes, which is supposed to have
occurred at Sault Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>Mi´nabō´zho (Great Rabbit), whose name occurs in connection with most
of the sacred rites, was the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, the Good Spirit,
and acted in the capacity of intercessor and mediator. It is generally
supposed that it was to his good offices that the Indian owes life and
the good things necessary to his health and subsistence.</p>

<p>The tradition of Mi´nabō´zho and the origin of the Midē´wiwin, as
given in connection with the birch-bark record obtained at Red Lake (<a
href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>), is as follows:</p>

<p>When Mi´nabō´zho, the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, looked down upon the
earth he beheld human beings, the Ani´shinâ´bēg, the ancestors of the
Ojibwa. They occupied the four quarters of the earth&mdash;the
northeast, the southeast, the southwest, and the northwest. He saw how
helpless they were, and desiring to give them the means of warding off
the diseases with which they were constantly afflicted, and to provide
them with animals and plants to serve as food and with other comforts,
Mi´nabō´zho remained thoughtfully hovering over the center of the earth,
endeavoring to devise some means of communicating with them, when he
heard something laugh, and perceived a dark object appear upon the
surface of the water to the west (No.&nbsp;2). He could not recognize
its form, and while watching it closely it slowly disappeared from view.
It next appeared in the north (No.&nbsp;3), and after a short lapse of
time again disappeared. Mi´nabō´zho hoped it would again show itself
upon the surface of the water, which it did in the east (No.&nbsp;4).
Then Mi´nabō´zho wished that it might approach him, so as to permit him
to communicate with it. When it disappeared from view in the east and
made its reappearance in the south (No.&nbsp;1), Mi´nabō´zho asked it to
come to the center of the earth that he might behold it. Again it
disappeared from view, and after reappearing in the west Mi´nabō´zho
observed it slowly approaching the center of the earth (i.e., the centre
of the circle), when he descended and saw it was the Otter, now one of
the sacred man´idōs of the Midē´wiwin. Then Mi´nabō´zho instructed the
Otter in the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin, and gave him at the same time
the sacred rattle to be used at the side of the sick; the sacred Midē´
drum to be used during the ceremonial of initiation and at sacred
feasts, and tobacco, to be employed in invocations and in making
peace.</p>

<p>The place where Mi´nabō´zho descended was an island in the middle of
a large body of water, and the Midē´ who is feared by all the others is
called Mini´sino´shkwe (He-who-lives-on-the-island). Then
<span class="pagenum">167</span>
<a name="page167" id="page167"> </a>
<!--png 217-->
Mi´nabō´zho built a Midē´wigân (sacred Midē´ lodge), and taking his drum
he beat upon it and sang a Midē´ song, telling the Otter that Dzhe
Man´idō had decided to help the Aníshinâ´bōg, that they might always
have life and an abundance of food and other things necessary for their
comfort. Mi´nabō´zho then took the Otter into the Midē´wigân and
conferred upon him the secrets of the Midē´wiwin, and with his Midē´ bag
shot the sacred mī´gis into his body that he might have immortality and
be able to confer these secrets to his kinsmen, the Aníshinâ´bēg.</p>

<p>The mī´gis is considered the sacred symbol of the Midē´wigân, and may
consist of any small white shell, though the one believed to be similar
to the one mentioned in the above tradition resembles the cowrie, and
the ceremonies of initiation as carried out in the Midē´wiwin at this
day are believed to be similar to those enacted by Mi´nabō´zho and the
Otter. It is admitted by all the Midē´ priests whom I have consulted
that much of the information has been lost through the death of their
aged predecessors, and they feel convinced that ultimately all of the
sacred character of the work will be forgotten or lost through the
adoption of new religions by the young people and the death of the Midē´
priests, who, by the way, decline to accept Christian teachings, and are
in consequence termed “pagans.”</p>

<p>My instructor and interpreter of the Red Lake chart added other
information in explanation of the various characters represented
thereon, which I present herewith. The large circle at the right side of
the chart denotes the earth as beheld by Mi´nabō´zho, while the Otter
appeared at the square projections at Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4; the
semicircular appendages between these are the four quarters of the
earth, which are inhabited by the Ani´shinâ´bēg, Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Nos. 9 and 10 represent two of the numerous malignant man´idōs, who
endeavor to prevent entrance into the sacred structure and mysteries of
the Midē´wiwin. The oblong squares, Nos. 11 and 12, represent the
outline of the first degree of the society, the inner corresponding
lines being the course traversed during initiation. The entrance to the
lodge is directed toward the east, the western exit indicating the
course toward the next higher degree. The four human forms at Nos. 13,
14, 15, and 16 are the four officiating Midē´ priests whose services are
always demanded at an initiation. Each is represented as having a
rattle. Nos. 17, 18, and 19 indicate the cedar trees, one of each of
this species being planted near the outer angles of a Midē´ lodge. No.
20 represents the ground. The outline of the bear at No. 21 represents
the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit, one of the sacred Midē´ man´idōs, to
which the candidate must pray and make offerings of tobacco, that he may
compel the malevolent spirits to draw away from the entrance to the
Midē´wigân, which is shown in No. 28. Nos 23 and 24 represent the sacred
drum which
<span class="pagenum">168</span>
<a name="page168" id="page168"> </a>
<!--png 218-->
the candidate must use when chanting the prayers, and two offerings must
be made, as indicated by the number two.</p>

<p>After the candidate has been admitted to one degree, and is prepared
to advance to the second, he offers three feasts, and chants three
prayers to the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit (No.&nbsp;22), that the
entrance (No.&nbsp;29) to that degree may be opened to him. The feasts
and chants are indicated by the three drums shown at Nos. 25, 26,
and&nbsp;27.</p>

<p>Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 are five Serpent Spirits, evil man´idōs
who oppose a Midē´’s progress, though after the feasting and prayers
directed to the Makwa´ Man´idō have by him been deemed sufficient the
four smaller Serpent Spirits move to either side of the path between the
two degrees, while the larger serpent (No.&nbsp;32) raises its body in
the middle so as to form an arch, beneath which passes the candidate on
his way to the second degree.</p>

<p>Nos. 35, 36, 46, and 47 are four malignant Bear Spirits, who guard
the entrance and exit to the second degree, the doors of which are at
Nos. 37 and 49. The form of this lodge (No.&nbsp;38) is like the
preceding; but while the seven Midē´ priests at Nos. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,
44, and 45 simply indicate that the number of Midē´ assisting at this
second initiation are of a higher and more sacred class of personages
than in the first degree, the number designated having reference to
quality and intensity rather than to the actual number of assistants, as
specifically shown at the top of the first degree structure.</p>

<p>When the Midē´ is of the second degree, he receives from Dzhe Man´idō
supernatural powers as shown in No. 48. The lines extending upward from
the eyes signify that he can look into futurity; from the ears, that he
can hear what is transpiring at a great distance; from the hands, that
he can touch for good or for evil friends and enemies at a distance,
however remote; while the lines extending from the feet denote his
ability to traverse all space in the accomplishment of his desires or
duties. The small disk upon the breast of the figure denotes that a
Midē´ of this degree has several times had the
mī´gis&mdash;life&mdash;“shot into his body,” the increased size of the
spot signifying amount or quantity of influence obtained thereby.</p>

<p>No. 50 represents a Mi´tsha Midē´ or Bad Midē´, one who employs his
powers for evil purposes. He has the power of assuming the form of any
animal, in which guise he may destroy the life of his victim,
immediately after which he resumes his human form and appears innocent
of any crime. His services are sought by people who wish to encompass
the destruction of enemies or rivals, at however remote a locality the
intended victim may be at the time. An illustration representing the
modus operandi of his performance is reproduced and explained in <a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>, page 238.</p>

<p>Persons possessed of this power are sometimes termed witches, special
reference to whom is made elsewhere. The illustration, No.
<span class="pagenum">169</span>
<a name="page169" id="page169"> </a>
<!--png 219-->
50, represents such an individual in his disguise of a bear, the
characters at Nos. 51 and 52 denoting footprints of a bear made by him,
impressions of which are sometimes found in the vicinity of lodges
occupied by his intended victims. The trees shown upon either side of
No. 50 signify a forest, the location usually sought by bad Midē´ and
witches.</p>

<p>If a second degree Midē´ succeeds in his desire to become a member of
the third degree, he proceeds in a manner similar to that before
described; he gives feasts to the instructing and four officiating
Midē´, and offers prayers to Dzhe Man´idō for favor and success. No. 53
denotes that the candidate now personates the bear&mdash;not one of the
malignant man´idōs, but one of the sacred man´idōs who are believed to
be present during the ceremonials of initiation of the second degree. He
is seated before his sacred drum, and when the proper time arrives the
Serpent Man´idō (No.&nbsp;54)&mdash;who has until this opposed his
advancement&mdash;now arches its body, and beneath it he crawls and
advances toward the door (No.&nbsp;55) of the third degree (No.&nbsp;56)
of the Midē´wiwin, where he encounters two (Nos. 57 and&nbsp;58) of the
four Panther Spirits, the guardians of this degree.</p>

<p>Nos. 61 to 76 indicate midē´ spirits who inhabit the structure of
this degree, and the number of human forms in excess of those shown in
connection with the second degree indicates a correspondingly higher and
more sacred character. When an Indian has passed this, initiation he
becomes very skillful in his profession of a Midē´. The powers which he
possessed in the second degree may become augmented. He is represented
in No. 77 with arms extended, and with lines crossing his body and arms
denoting darkness and obscurity, which signifies his ability to grasp
from the invisible world the knowledge and means to accomplish
extraordinary deeds. He feels more confident of prompt response and
assistance from the sacred man´idōs and his knowledge of them becomes
more widely extended.</p>

<p>Nos. 59 and 60 are two of the four Panther Spirits who are the
special guardians of the third degree lodge.</p>

<p>To enter the fourth and highest degree of the society requires a
greater number of feasts than before, and the candidate, who continues
to personate the Bear Spirit, again uses his sacred drum, as he is shown
sitting before it in No. 78, and chants more prayers to Dzhe Man´idō for
his favor. This degree is guarded by the greatest number and the most
powerful of malevolent spirits, who make a last effort to prevent a
candidate’s entrance at the door (No.&nbsp;79) of the fourth degree
structure (No.&nbsp;80). The chief opponents to be overcome, through the
assistance of Dzhe Man´idō, are two Panther Spirits (Nos. 81
and&nbsp;82) at the eastern entrance, and two Bear Spirits (Nos. 83
and&nbsp;84) at the western exit. Other bad spirits are about the
structure, who frequently gain possession and are then enabled to make
strong and prolonged resistance to the candidate’s entrance.
<span class="pagenum">170</span>
<a name="page170" id="page170"> </a>
<!--png 220-->
The chiefs of this group of malevolent beings are Bears (Nos. 88
and&nbsp;96), the Panther (No.&nbsp;91), the Lynx (No.&nbsp;97), and
many others whose names they have forgotten, their positions being
indicated at Nos. 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, and 95, all but the
last resembling characters ordinarily employed to designate
serpents.</p>

<p>The power with which it is possible to become endowed after passing
through the fourth degree is expressed by the outline of a human figure
(No.&nbsp;98), upon which are a number of spots indicating that the body
is covered with the mī´gis or sacred shells, symbolical of the
Midē´wiwin. These spots designate the places where the Midē´ priests,
during the initiation, shot into his body the mī´gis and the lines
connecting them in order that all the functions of the several
corresponding parts or organs of the body may be exercised.</p>

<p>The ideal fourth degree Midē´ is presumed to be in a position to
accomplish the greatest feats in necromancy and magic. He is not only
endowed with the power of reading the thoughts and intentions of others,
as is pictorially indicated by the mī´gis spot upon the top of the head,
but to call forth the shadow (soul) and retain it within his grasp at
pleasure. At this stage of his pretensions, he is encroaching upon the
prerogatives of the Jĕs´sakkīd´, and is then recognized as one, as he
usually performs within the Jĕs´sakkân or Jĕs´sakkīd´ lodge, commonly
designated “the Jugglery.”</p>

<p>The ten small circular objects upon the upper part of the record may
have been some personal marks of the original owner; their import was
not known to my informants and they do not refer to any portion of the
history or ceremonies or the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>Extending toward the left from the end of the fourth degree inclosure
is an angular pathway (No.&nbsp;99), which represents the course to be
followed by the Midē´ after he has attained this high distinction. On
account of his position his path is often beset with dangers, as
indicated by the right angles, and temptations which may lead him
astray; the points at which he may possibly deviate from the true course
of propriety are designated by projections branching off obliquely
toward the right and left (No. 100). The ovoid figure (No. 101) at the
end of this path is termed Wai-ĕk´-ma-yŏk´&mdash;End of the
road&mdash;and is alluded to in the ritual, as will be observed
hereafter, as the end of the world, i.e., the end of the individual’s
existence. The number of vertical strokes (No. 102) within the ovoid
figure signify the original owner to have been a fourth degree Midē´ for
a period of 14 years.</p>

<p>The outline of the Midē´wigân (No. 103) not only denotes that the
same individual was a member of the Midē´wiwin, but the thirteen
vertical strokes shown in Nos. 104 and 105 indicate that he was chief
Midē´ priest of the society for that number of years.</p>

<p>The outline of a Midē´wigân as shown at No. 106, with the place upon
the interior designating the location of the sacred post (No.
<span class="pagenum">171</span>
<a name="page171" id="page171"> </a>
<!--png 223-->
107) and the stone (No. 108) against which the sick are placed during
the time of treatment, signifies the owner to have practiced his calling
of the exorcism of demons. But that he also visited the sick beyond the
acknowledged jurisdiction of the society in which he resided, is
indicated by the path (No. 109) leading around the sacred inclosure.</p>

<p>Upon that portion of the chart immediately above the fourth degree
lodge is shown the outline of a Midē´wiwin (No. 110), with a path (No.
114), leading toward the west to a circle (No. 111), within which is
another similar structure (No. 112) whose longest diameter is at right
angles to the path, signifying that it is built so that its entrance is
at the north. This is the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân or Ghost Lodge.</p>

<p>Around the interior of the circle are small V-shaped characters
denoting the places occupied by the spirits of the departed, who are
presided over by the Dzhibai´ Midē´, literally Shadow Midē´.</p>

<p>No. 113 represents the Kŏ´-kó-kŏ-ō´ (Owl) passing from the Midē´wigân
to the Land of the Setting Sun, the place of the dead, upon the road of
the dead, indicated by the pathway at No. 114. This man´idō is
personated by a candidate for the first degree of the Midē´wiwin when
giving a feast to the dead in honor of the shadow of him who had been
dedicated to the Midē´wiwin and whose place is now to be taken by the
giver of the feast.</p>

<p>Upon the back of the Midē´ record, above described, is the personal
record of the original owner, as shown in <a href="#plateIII">Pl.
<span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;B</a>. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4
represent the four degrees of the society into which he has been
initiated, or, to use the phraseology of an Ojibwa, “through which he
has gone.” This “passing through” is further illustrated by the bear
tracks, he having personated the Makwa´ Man´idō or Bear Spirit,
considered to be the highest and most powerful of the guardian spirits
of the fourth degree wigwam.</p>

<p>The illustration presented in <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;C</a> represents the outlines of a
birch-bark record (reduced to one-third) found among the effects of a
lately deceased Midē´ from Leech Lake, Minnesota. This record, together
with a number of other curious articles, composed the outfit of the
Midē´, but the Rev. James A. Gilfillan of White Earth, through whose
courtesy I was permitted to examine the objects, could give me no
information concerning their use. Since that time, however, I have had
an opportunity of consulting with one of the chief priests of the Leech
Lake Society, through whom I have obtained some interesting data
concerning them.</p>

<p>The chart represents the owner to have been a Midē´ of the second
degree, as indicated by the two outlines of the respective structures at
Nos. 1 and 2, the place of the sacred posts being marked at Nos. 3 and
4. Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 are Midē´ priests holding their Midē´ bags as in
the ceremony of initiation. The disks represented at Nos.

9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 denote the sacred drum, which may be used by him
during his initiation, while Nos. 14, 15, 16, and 17 denote that he was
one of the four officiating priests of the Midē´wigân at his place of
residence. Each of these figures is represented as holding their sacred
bags as during the ceremonies. No. 18 denotes the path he has been
pursuing since he became a Midē´, while at Nos. 19 and 20 diverging
lines signify that his course is beset with temptations and enemies, as
referred to in the description of the Red Lake chart, <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>.</p>

degrees is a copy of a record in the possession of the chief Midē´ at
Mille Lacs in 1830, at which time Sikas´sigĕ, at the age of 10 years,
received his first degree. For a number of years thereafter Sikas´sigĕ
received continued instruction from his father Baiē´dzhĕk, and although
he never publicly received advancement beyond the second degree of the
society, his wife became a fourth degree priestess, at whose initiation
he was permitted to be present.</p>

<p>Since his residence at White Earth Sikas´sigĕ has become one of the
officiating priests of the society at that place. One version given by
him of the origin of the Indians is presented in the following
tradition, a pictorial representation having also been prepared of which
<a href="#plateV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">V</span></a> is
a reduced copy:</p>

<blockquote>In the beginning, Dzhe Man´idō (No.&nbsp;1), made the Midē´
Man´idōs. He first created two men (Nos. 2 and&nbsp;3), and two women
(Nos. 4 and&nbsp;5); but they had no power of thought or reason. Then
Dzhe Man´idō (No.&nbsp;1) made them rational beings. He took them in his
hands so that they should multiply; he paired them, and from this sprung
the Indians. When there were people he placed them upon the earth, but
he soon observed that they were subject to sickness, misery, and death,
and that unless he provided them with the Sacred Medicine they would
soon become extinct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Between the position occupied by Dzhe Man´idō and the earth
were four lesser spirits (Nos. 6, 7, 8, and&nbsp;9) with whom Dzhe
Man´idō decided to commune, and to impart to them the mysteries by which
the Indians could be benefited. So he first spoke to a spirit at No. 6,
and told him all he had to say, who in turn communicated the same
information to No. 7, and he in turn to No. 8, who also communed with
No. 9. They all met in council, and determined to call in the four wind
gods at Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. After consulting as to what would be
best for the comfort and welfare of the Indians, these spirits agreed to
ask Dzhe Man´idō to communicate the Mystery of the Sacred Medicine to
the people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dzhe Man´idō then went to the Sun Spirit (No.&nbsp;14) and
asked him to go to the earth and instruct the people as had been decided
upon by the council. The Sun Spirit, in the form of a little boy, went
to the earth and lived with a woman (No.&nbsp;15) who had a little boy
of her own.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This family went away in the autum to hunt, and during the
winter this woman’s
<span class="pagenum">173</span>

son died. The parents were so much distressed that they decided to
return to the village and bury the body there; so they made preparations
to return, and as they traveled along, they would each evening erect
several poles upon which the body was placed to prevent the wild beasts
from devouring it. When the dead boy was thus hanging upon the poles,
the adopted child&mdash;who was the Sun Spirit&mdash;would play about
the camp and amuse himself, and finally told his adopted father he
pitied him, and his mother, for their sorrow. The adopted son said he
could bring his dead brother to life, whereupon the parents expressed
great surprise and desired to know how that could be
accomplished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The adopted boy then had the party hasten to the village,
when he said, “Get the women to make a wig´iwam of bark (No.&nbsp;16),
put the dead boy in a covering of birch bark and place the body on the
ground in the middle of the wig´iwam<ins class="correction" title="close quote missing">.”</ins> On the next morning after this had been
done, the family and friends went into this lodge and seated themselves
around the corpse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When they had all been sitting quietly for some time, they
saw through the doorway the approach of a bear (No.&nbsp;17) which
gradually came towards the wig´iwam, entered it, and placed itself
before the dead body and said hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, when he passed around it
towards the left side, with a trembling motion, and as he did so, the
body began quivering, and the quivering increased as the bear continued
until he had passed around four times, when the body came to life again
and stood up. Then the bear called to the father, who was sitting in the
distant right-hand corner of the wig´iwam, and addressed to him the
following words:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The little bear boy (No.&nbsp;17) was the one who did this.
He then remained among the Indians (No.&nbsp;18) and taught them the
mysteries of the Grand Medicine (No.&nbsp;19); and, after he had
finished, he told his adopted father that as his mission had been
fulfilled he was to return to his kindred spirits, for the Indians would
have no need to fear sickness as they now possessed the Grand Medicine
which would enable them to live. He also said that his spirit could
bring a body to life but once, and he would now return to the sun from
which they would feel his influence.</blockquote>

<p>This is called Kwí-wĭ-sĕns´ wĕ-dī´-shĭ-tshī
gē-wī-nĭp&mdash;“Little-boy-his-work.”</p>

<p>From subsequent information it was learned that the line No. 22
denotes the earth, and that, being considered as one step in the course
of initiation into the Midē´wiwin, three others must be taken before a
candidate can be admitted. These steps, or rests, as they are
denominated (Nos. 23, 24, and&nbsp;25), are typified by four distinct
gifts of goods, which must be remitted to the Midē´ priests before the
ceremony can take place.</p>

<p>Nos. 18 and 19 are repetitions of the figures alluded to in the
tradition (Nos. 16 and&nbsp;17) to signify that the candidate must
personate the Makwa´ Man´idō&mdash;Bear Spirit&mdash;when entering the
Midē´wiwin (No.&nbsp;19). No. 20 is the Midē´ Man´idō as Ki´tshi Man´idō
is termed
<span class="pagenum">174</span>
<a name="page174" id="page174"> </a>
<!--png 228-->
by the Midē´ priests. The presence of horns attached to the head is a
common symbol of superior power found in connection with the figures of
human and divine forms in many Midē´ songs and other mnemonic records.
No. 21 represents the earth’s surface, similar to that designated at
No.&nbsp;22.</p>

<p>Upon comparing the preceding tradition of the creation of the Indians
with the following, which pertains to the descent to earth of
Mi´nabō´zho, there appears to be some discrepancy, which could not be
explained by Sikas´sigĕ, because he had forgotten the exact sequence of
events; but from information derived from other Midē´ it is evident that
there have been joined together two myths, the intervening circumstances
being part of the tradition given below in connection with the narrative
relating to the chart on <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>.</p>

<p>This chart, which was in possession of the Mille Lacs chief
Baiē´dzhĕk, was copied by him from that belonging to his preceptor at La
Pointe about the year 1800, and although the traditions given by
Sikas´sigĕ is similar to the one surviving at Red Lake, the diagram is
an interesting variant for the reason that there is a greater amount of
detail in the delineation of objects mentioned in the tradition.</p>

<p>By referring to <a href="#plateIV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">IV</span></a> it will be noted that the circle, No. 1,
resembles the corresponding circle at the beginning of the record on <a
href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, with this difference, that the four
quarters of the globe inhabited by the Ani´shinâ´bēg are not designated
between the cardinal points at which the Otter appeared, and also that
the central island, only alluded to there (<a href="#plateIII">Pl.
<span class="smallroman">III</span>&nbsp;A</a>), is here inserted.</p>

<p>The correct manner of arranging the two pictorial records, Pls. <span

(<a href="#plateV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">V</span></a>,
No.&nbsp;21) upon the island indicated in <a href="#plateIV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">IV</span></a>, No. 6, so
that the former stands vertically and at right angles to the latter; for
the reason that the first half of the tradition pertains to the
consultation held between Ki´tshi Man´idō and the four lesser spirits
which is believed to have occurred above the earth’s surface. According
to Sikas´sigĕ the two charts should be joined as suggested in the
accompanying illustration, <a href="#fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

Sikas´sigĕ’s explanation of the Mille Lacs chart (<a href="#plateIV">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">IV</span></a>) is
substantially as follows:</p>

<blockquote>When Mi´nabō´zho descended to the earth to give to the
Ani´shinâ´bēg the Midē´wiwin, he left with them this chart,
Midē´wigwas´. Ki´tshi Man´idō saw that his people on earth were without
the means of protecting themselves against disease and death, so he sent
Mi´nabō´zho to give to them the sacred gift. Mi´nabō´zho appeared over
the waters and while reflecting in what manner he should be able to
communicate with the people, he heard something laugh, just as an otter
sometimes cries out. He saw something black appear upon the waters in
the west (No.&nbsp;2) which immediately disappeared beneath the surface
again. Then it came up at the northern horizon (No.&nbsp;3), which
pleased Mi´nabō´zho, as he thought he now had some one through whom he
might convey the information with which he had been charged by Ki´tshi
Man´idō. When the black object disappeared beneath the waters at the
north to reappear in the east (No.&nbsp;4), Mi´nabō´zho desired it would
come to him in the middle of the waters, but it disappeared to make its
reappearance in the south (No.&nbsp;5), where it again sank out of sight
to reappear in the west (No.&nbsp;2), when Mi´nabō´zho asked it to
approach the center where there was an island (No.&nbsp;6), which it
did. This did Ni´gĭk, the Otter, and for this reason he is given charge
of the first degree of the Midē´wiwin (Nos. 35 and&nbsp;36) where his
spirit always abides during initiation and when healing the
sick.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Ni´gĭk asked Mi´nabō´zho, “Why do you come to this
place?” When the latter said, “I have pity on the Ani´shinâ´bēg and wish
to give them life; Ki´tshi Man´idō gave me the power to confer upon them
the means of protecting themselves against sickness and death, and
through you I will give them the Midē´wiwin, and teach them the sacred
rites.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Mi´nabō´zho built a Midē´wigân in which he instructed
the Otter in all the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin. The Otter sat before
the door of the Midē´wigân four days (Nos. 7, 8, 9, and&nbsp;10),
sunning himself, after which time he approached the entrance
(No.&nbsp;14), where his progress was arrested (No.&nbsp;11) by seeing
two bad spirits (Nos. 12 and&nbsp;13) guarding it. Through the powers
possessed by Mi´nabō´zho he was enabled to pass these; when he entered
the sacred lodge (No.&nbsp;15), the first object he beheld being the
sacred stone (No.&nbsp;16) against which those who were sick were to be
seated, or laid, when undergoing the ceremonial of restoring them to
health. He next saw a post (No.&nbsp;17) painted red with a green band
around the top. A sick man would also have to pray
<span class="pagenum">176</span>
<a name="page176" id="page176"> </a>
<!--png 232-->
to the stone and to the post, when he is within the Midē´wigân, because
within them would be the Midē´ spirits whose help he invoked. The Otter
was then taken to the middle of the Midē´wigân where he picked up the
mī´gis (No.&nbsp;18) from among a heap of sacred objects which form part
of the gifts given by Ki´tshi Man´idō. The eight man´idōs around the
midē´wigân (Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and&nbsp;26) were also sent
by Ki´tshi Man´idō to guard the lodge against the entrance of bad
spirits.</blockquote>

<p>A life is represented by the line No. 27, the signification of the
short lines (Nos. 28, 29, 30, and&nbsp;31) denoting that the course of
human progress is beset by temptations and trials which may be the cause
of one’s departure from such course of conduct as is deemed proper, and
the beliefs taught by the Midē´. When one arrives at middle age
(No.&nbsp;32) his course for the remaining period of life is usually
without any special events, as indicated by the plain line No. 27,
extending from middle age (No.&nbsp;32) to the end of one’s existence
(No.&nbsp;33). The short lines at Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31, indicating
departure from the path of propriety, terminate in rounded spots and
signify, literally, “lecture places,” because when a Midē´ feels himself
failing in duty or vacillating in faith he must renew professions by
giving a feast and lecturing to his confreres, thus regaining his
strength to resist evil doing&mdash;such as making use of his powers in
harming his kinsmen, teaching that which was not given him by Ki´tshi
Man´idō through Mi´nabō´zho, etc. His heart must be cleansed and his
tongue guarded.</p>

<p>To resume the tradition of the course pursued by the Otter,
Sikas´sigĕ said:</p>

<blockquote>The Otter then went round the interior of the Midē´wigân
(No.&nbsp;34), and finally seated himself in the west, where Mi´nabō´zho
shot into his body the sacred mī´gis, which was in his Midē´ bag. Then
Mi´nabō´zho said, “This is your lodge and you shall own it always (Nos.
35 and&nbsp;36), and eight Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 19-26) <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘shal’">shall</ins> guard it during the
night.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Otter was taken to the entrance (No.&nbsp;37) of the
second degree structure (No.&nbsp;38), which he saw was guarded by two
evil man´idōs (Nos. 39 and&nbsp;40), who opposed his progress, but who
were driven away by Mi´nabō´zho. When the Otter entered at the door he
beheld the sacred stone (No.&nbsp;41) and two posts (Nos. 42,&nbsp;43),
the one nearest to him being painted red with a green band around the
top, and another at the middle, with a bunch of little feathers upon the
top. The other post (No.&nbsp;43) was painted red, with only a band of
green at the top, similar to the first degree post. Nos. 44 and 45 are
the places where sacred objects and gifts are placed. This degree of the
Midē´wiwin is guarded at night by twelve Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 46
to&nbsp;57) placed there by Ki´tshi Man´idō, and the degree is owned by
the Thunder Bird as shown in Nos. 58,&nbsp;59.</blockquote>

<p>The circles (Nos. 60, 61, and&nbsp;62) at either end of the outline
of the structure denoting the degree and beneath it are connected by a
line (No.&nbsp;63) as in the preceding degree, and are a mere repetition
to denote the course of conduct to be pursued by the Midē´. The points
(Nos. 64, 65, 66, and&nbsp;67), at the termini of the shorter lines,
also refer to the feasts and lectures to be given in case of need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">177</span>
<a name="page177" id="page177"> </a>
<!--png 233-->
To continue the informant’s tradition:</p>

<blockquote>When the Otter had passed around the interior of the
Midē´wigân four times, he seated himself in the west and faced the
degree post, when Mi´nabō´zho again shot into his body the mī´gis, which
gave him renewed life. Then the Otter was told to take a “sweat bath”
once each day for four successive days, so as to prepare for the next
degree. (This number is indicated at the rounded spots at Nos. 68, 69,
70, and&nbsp;71.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third degree of the Midē´wiwin (No.&nbsp;72) is guarded
during the day by two Midē´ spirits (Nos. 73,&nbsp;74) near the eastern
entrance, and by the Makwa´ Man´idō within the inclosure (Nos. 75
and&nbsp;76), and at night by eighteen Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 77
to&nbsp;94), placed there by Ki´tshi Man´idō. When the Otter approached
the entrance (No.&nbsp;95) he was again arrested in his progress by two
evil man´idōs (Nos. 96 and&nbsp;97), who opposed his admission, but
Mi´nibō´zho overcame them and the Otter entered. Just inside of the
door, and on each side, the Otter saw a post (Nos. 98 and&nbsp;99), and
at the western door or exit two corresponding posts (Nos. 100 and 101).
These symbolized the four legs of the Makwa´ Man´idō, or Bear Spirit,
who is the guardian by day and the owner of the third degree. The Otter
then observed the sacred stone (No. 102) and the two heaps of sacred
objects (Nos. 103 and 104) which Mi´nabō´zho had deposited, and three
degree posts (Nos. 105, 106, and 107), the first of which (No. 105) was
a plain cedar post with the bark upon it, but sharpened at the top; the
second (No. 106), a red post with a green band round the top and one
about the middle, as in the second degree; and the third a cross (No.
107) painted red, each of the tips painted green. [The vertical line No.
108 was said to have no relation to anything connected with the
tradition.] After the Otter had observed the interior of the Midē´wigân
he again made four circuits, after which he took his station in the
west, where he seated himself, facing the sacred degree posts. Then
Mi´nabō´zho, for the third time, shot into his body the mī´gis, thus
adding to the powers which he already possessed, after which he was to
prepare for the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin.</blockquote>

<p>Other objects appearing upon the chart were subsequently explained as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>The four trees (Nos. 109, 110, 111, and 112), one of which
is planted at each of the four corners of the Midē´wigân, are usually
cedar, though pine may be taken as a substitute when the former can not
be had. The repetition of the circles Nos. 113, 114, and 115 and
connecting line No. 116, with the short lines at Nos. 117, 118, 119, and
120, have the same signification as in the preceding two
degrees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the Otter had received the third degree he prepared
himself for the fourth, and highest, by taking a steam bath once a day
for four successive days (Nos. 121, 122, 123, and 124). Then, as he
proceeded toward the Midē´wigân he came to a wig´iwam made of brush (No.
179), which was the nest of Makwa´ Man´idō, the Bear Spirit, who guarded
the four doors of the sacred structure.</blockquote>

<p>The four rows of spots have reference to the four entrances of the
Midē´wigân of the fourth degree. The signification of the spots near the
larger circle, just beneath the “Bear’s nest” could not be explained by
Sikas´sigĕ, but the row of spots (No. 117) along the horizontal line
leading to the entrance of the inclosure were denominated steps, or
stages of progress, equal to as many days&mdash;one spot denoting one
day&mdash;which must elapse before the Otter was permitted to view the
entrance.</p>

<blockquote>When the Otter approached the fourth degree (No. 118) he
came to a short post
<span class="pagenum">178</span>
<a name="page178" id="page178"> </a>
<!--png 234-->
(No. 119) in which there was a small aperture. The post was painted
green on the side from which he approached and red upon the side toward
the Midē´wigân [see <a href="#fig4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.] But before he
was permitted to look through it he rested and invoked the favor of
Ki´tshi Man´idō, that the evil man´idōs might be expelled from his path.
Then, when the Otter looked through the post, he saw that the interior
of the inclosure was filled with Midē´ Man´idos, ready to receive him
and to attend during his initiation. The two Midē´ Man´idos at the
outside of the eastern entrance (Nos. 120 and 121) compelled the evil
man´idōs (Nos. 122 and 123) to depart and permit the Otter to enter at
the door (No. 124). Then the Otter beheld the sacred stone (No. 125) and
the five heaps of sacred objects which <ins class="correction" title="so in original: word is usually written ‘Mi´nabō´zho’">Minabō´zho</ins>
had deposited (Nos. 126, 127, 128, 129, and 130) near the four degree
posts (Nos. 131, 132, 133, and 134). According to their importance, the
first was painted red, with a green band about the top; the second was
painted red, with two green bands, one at the top and another at the
middle; the third consisted of a cross painted red, with the tips of the
arms and the top of the post painted green; while the fourth was a
square post, the side toward the east being painted white, that toward
the south green, that toward the west red, and that toward the north
black.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two sets of sticks (Nos. 135 and 136) near the eastern
and western doors represent the legs of Makwa´ Man´idō, the Bear Spirit.
When the Otter had observed all these things he passed round the
interior of the Midē´wigân four times, after which he seated himself in
the west, facing the degree posts, when Mi´nabō´zho approached him and
for the fourth time shot into his body the sacred mī´gis, which gave him
life that will endure always. Then Mi´nabō´zho said to the Otter, “This
degree belongs to Ki´tshi Man´ido, the Great Spirit (Nos. 137 and 138),
who will always be present when you give the sacred rite to any of your
people.” At night the Midē´ Man´idōs (Nos. 139 to 162) will guard the
Midē´wigân, as they are sent by Ki´tshi Man´ido to do so. The Bear’s
nest (Nos. 163 and 164) just beyond the northern and southern doors
(Nos. 165 and 166) of the Midē´wigân are the places where Makwa´ Man´idō
takes his station when guarding the doors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the Otter made a wig´iwam and offered four prayers
(Nos. 167, 168, 169, and 170) for the rites of the Midē´wiwin, which
Ki´tshi Man´idō had given him.</blockquote>

<p>The following supplemental explanations were added by Sikas´sigĕ,
viz: The four vertical lines at the outer angles of the lodge structure
(Nos. 171, 172, 173, and 174), and four similar ones on the inner
corners (Nos. 175, 176, 177, and 178), represent eight cedar trees
planted there by the Midē´ at the time of preparing the Midē´wigân for
the reception of candidates. The circles Nos. 179, 180, and 181, and the
connecting line, are a reproduction of similar ones shown in the three
preceding degrees, and signify the course of a Midē’s life&mdash;that it
should be without fault and in strict accordance with the teachings of
the Midē´wiwin. The short lines, terminating in circles Nos. 182, 183,
184, and 185, allude to temptations which beset the Midē’s path, and he
shall, when so tempted, offer at these points feasts and lectures, or,
in other words, “professions of faith.” The three lines Nos. 186, 187,
and 188, consisting of four

spots each, which radiate from the larger circle at No. 179 and that
before mentioned at No. 116, symbolize the four bear nests and their
respective approaches, which are supposed to be placed opposite the four
doors of the fourth degree; and it is obligatory, therefore, for a
candidate to enter these four doors on hands and knees when appearing
for his initiation and before he finally waits to receive the concluding
portion of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The illustration presented in <a href="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> is a
reduced copy of a drawing made by Sikas´sigĕ to represent the migration
of the Otter toward the west after he had received the rite of the
Midē´wiwin. No. 1 refers to the circle upon the large chart on <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span></a> in A, No. 1,
and signifies the earth’s surface as before described. No. 2 in <a href="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> is a line separating the history of the
Midē´wiwin from that of the migration as follows: When the Otter had
offered four prayers, as above mentioned, which fact is referred to by
the spot No. 3, he disappeared beneath the surface of the water and went
toward the west, whither the Ani´shinâ´bēg followed him, and located at
Ottawa Island (No.&nbsp;4). Here they erected the Midē´wigân and lived
for many years. Then the Otter again disappeared beneath the water, and
in a short time reappeared at A´wiat´ang (No.&nbsp;5), when the
Midē´wigân was again erected and the sacred rites conducted in
accordance with the teachings of Mi´nabō´zho. Thus was an interrupted
migration continued, the several resting places being given below in
their proper order, at each of which the rites of the Midē´wiwin were
conducted in all their purity. The next place to locate at was

ceremonies of the Midē´wiwin.</p>

Plate VI. Ojibwa Facial Decoration.</p>

<p>According to Sikas´sigĕ, the above account of the initiation of the
Otter, by Mi´nabo´zho, was adopted as the course of initiation by the
Midē´ priests of the Mille Lacs Society, when he himself received the
first degree, 1830. At that time a specific method of facial decoration
was pursued by the priests of the respective degrees (<a href="#plateVI">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">VI</span></a>), each
adopting that pertaining to the highest degree to which he was entitled,
viz:</p>

<p><i>First degree.</i>&mdash;A broad band of green across the forehead
and a narrow stripe of vermilion across the face, just below the
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Second degree.</i>&mdash;A narrow stripe of vermilion across the
temples, the eyelids, and the root of the nose, a short distance above
which is a similar stripe of green, then another of vermilion, and above
this again one of green.</p>

<p><i>Third degree.</i>&mdash;Red and white spots are daubed all over
the face, the spots being as large as can be made by the finger tips in
applying the colors.</p>

<p><i>Fourth degree.</i>&mdash;Two forms of decoration were admissible;
for the first, the face was painted with vermilion, with a stripe of
green extending diagonally across it from the upper part of the left
temporal region to the lower part of the right cheek; for the second,
the face was painted red with two short, horizontal parallel bars of
<span class="pagenum">181</span>
<a name="page181" id="page181"> </a>
<!--png 239-->
green across the forehead. Either of these was also employed as a sign
of mourning by one whose son has been intended for the priesthood of the
Midē´wiwin, but special reference to this will be given in connection
with the ceremony of the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân, or Ghost Society.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateVIII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">VIII</span></a> is presented a reduced copy of the Midē´
chart made by Ojibwa, a Midē´ priest of the fourth degree and formerly a
member of the society of the Sandy Lake band of the Mississippi Ojibwa.
The illustration is copied from his own chart which he received in 1833
in imitation of that owned by his father, Me´toshi´kō<sup>n</sup>sh; and
this last had been received from Lake Superior, presumably La Pointe,
many years before.</p>

<p>The illustration of the four degrees are here represented in profile,
and shows higher artistic skill than the preceding copies from Red Lake,
and Mille Lacs.</p>

<p>The information given by Ojibwa, regarding the characters is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>When Ki´tshi Man´idō had decided to give to the
Ani´shinâ´bēg the rites of the Midē´wiwin, he took his Midē´ drum and
sang, calling upon the other Man´idōs <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘to to’">to</ins> join him and to hear what he was going to
do. No. 1 represents the abode in the sky of Ki´tshi Man´idō, No. 2,
indicating the god as he sits drumming, No. 3. the small spots
surrounding the drum denoting the mī´gis with which everything about him
is covered. The Midē´ Man´idōs came to him in his Midē´wigân
(No.&nbsp;4), eleven of which appear upon the inside of that structure,
while the ten&mdash;all but himself&mdash;upon the outside (Nos. 5
to&nbsp;14) are represented as descending to the earth, charged with the
means of conferring upon the Ani´shinâbē´g the sacred rite. In the
Midē´wigân (No.&nbsp;4) is shown also the sacred post (No.&nbsp;15) upon
which is perched Kŏ-ko´kŏ-ō&mdash;the Owl (No.&nbsp;16). The line
traversing the structure, from side to side, represents the trail
leading through it, while the two rings (Nos. 17 and&nbsp;18) upon the
right side of the post indicate respectively the spot where the presents
are deposited and the sacred stone&mdash;this according to modern
practices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When an Indian is prepared to receive the rights of
initiation he prepares a wig´iwam (No.&nbsp;19) in which he takes a
steam bath once each day for four successive days. The four baths and
four days are indicated by the number of spots at the floor of the
lodge, representing stones. The instructors, employed by him, and the
officiating priests of the society are present, one of which
(No.&nbsp;20) may be observed upon the left of the wig´iwam in the act
of making an offering of smoke, while the one to the right (No.&nbsp;21)
is drumming and singing. The four officiating priests are visible to
either side of the candidate within the structure. The wig´iwams (Nos.
22, 23, 24, and&nbsp;25) designate the village habitations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the evening of the day preceding the initiation, the
candidate (No.&nbsp;26) visits his instructor (No.&nbsp;27) to receive
from him final directions as to the part to be enacted upon the
following day. The candidate is shown in the act of carrying with him
his pipe, the offering of tobacco being the most acceptable of all
gifts. His relatives follow and carry the goods and other presents, some
of which are suspended from the branches of the Midē´ tree (No.&nbsp;28)
near the entrance of the first degree structure. The instructor’s
wig´iwam is shown at No. 29, the two dark circular spots upon the floor
showing two of the seats, occupied by instructor and pupil. The figure
No. 27 has his left arm elevated, denoting that his conversation
pertains to Ki´tshi Man´idō, while in his right hand he holds his Midē´
drum. Upon the following
<span class="pagenum">182</span>
<a name="page182" id="page182"> </a>
<!--png 240-->
morning the Midē´ priests, with the candidate in advance (No.&nbsp;30),
approach and enter the Midē´wigân and the initiation begins. No. 31 is
the place of the sacred drum and those who are detailed to employ the
drum and rattles, while No. 32 indicates the officiating priests; No. 33
is the degree post, surmounted by Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´, the Owl (No.&nbsp;34).
The post is painted with vermilion, with small white spots all over its
surface, emblematic of the mī´gis shell. The line (No.&nbsp;35)
extending along the upper portion of the inclosure represents the pole
from which are suspended the robes, blankets, kettles, etc., which
constitute the fee paid to the society for admission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This degree is presided over and guarded by the Panther
Man´idō.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the candidate has been able to procure enough gifts to
present to the society for the second degree, he takes his drum and
offers chants (No.&nbsp;35) to Ki´tshi Man´idō for success. Ki´tshi
Man´idō himself is the guardian of the second degree and his footprints
are shown in No. 36. No. 37 represents the second degree inclosure, and
contains two sacred posts (Nos. 38 and&nbsp;39), the first of which is
the same as that of the first degree, the second being painted with
white clay, bearing two bands of vermilion, one about the top and one
near the middle. A small branch near the top is used, after the ceremony
is over, to hang the tobacco pouch on. No. 40 represents the musicians
and attendants; No. 41 the candidate upon his knees; while Nos. 42, 43,
44, and 45 pictures the officiating priests who surround him. The
horizontal pole (No.&nbsp;46) has presents of robes, blankets, and
kettles suspended from&nbsp;it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When a candidate is prepared to advance to the third degree
(No.&nbsp;47) he personates Makwa´ Man´idō, who is the guardian of this
degree, and whose tracks (No.&nbsp;48) are visible. The assistants are
visible upon the interior, drumming and dancing. There are three sacred
posts, the first (No.&nbsp;49) is black, and upon this is placed
Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the Owl; the second (No.&nbsp;50) is painted with
white clay and has upon the top the effigy of an owl; while the third
(No.&nbsp;51) is painted with vermilion, bearing upon the summit the
effigy of an Indian. Small wooden effigies of the human figure are used
by the Midē´ in their tests of the proof of the genuineness and
sacredness of their religion, which tests will be alluded to under
another caption. The horizontal rod (No.&nbsp;52), extending from one
end of the structure to the other, has suspended from it the blankets
and other gifts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The guardian of the fourth degree is Maka´no&mdash;the
Turtle&mdash;as he appears (No.&nbsp;53) facing the entrance of the
fourth degree (No.&nbsp;54). Four sacred posts are planted in the fourth
degree; the first (No.&nbsp;55), being painted white upon the upper half
and green upon the lower; the second (No.&nbsp;56) similar; the third
(No.&nbsp;57) painted red, with a black spiral line extending from the
top to the bottom, and upon which is placed Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the Owl;
and the fourth (No.&nbsp;58), a cross, the arms and part of the trunk of
which is white, with red spots&mdash;to designate the sacred
mī´gis&mdash;the lower half of the trunk cut square, the face toward the
east painted red, the south green, the west white, and the north black.
The spot (No.&nbsp;59) at the base of the cross signifies the place of
the sacred stone, while the human figures (No.&nbsp;60) designate the
participants, some of whom are seated near the wall of the inclosure,
whilst others are represented as beating the drum. Upon the horizontal
pole (No.&nbsp;61) are shown the blankets constituting gifts to the
society.</blockquote>

Plate VII. Ojibwa Facial Decoration.</p>

<p>The several specific methods of facial decoration employed (<a href="#plateVII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">VII</span></a>),
according to Ojibwa’s statement, are as follows:</p>

<p><i>First degree.</i>&mdash;One stripe of vermilion across the face,
from near the ears across the tip of the nose.</p>

<p><i>Second degree.</i>&mdash;One stripe as above, and another across
the eyelids, temples, and the root of the nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">183</span>
<a name="page183" id="page183"> </a>
<!--png 243-->
<i>Third degree.</i>&mdash;The upper half of the face is painted green
and the lower half red.</p>

<p><i>Fourth degree.</i>&mdash;The forehead and left side of the face,
from the outer canthus of the eye downward, is painted green; four spots
of vermilion are made with the tip of the finger upon the forehead and
four upon the green surface of the left cheek. In addition to this, the
plumes of the golden eagle, painted red, are worn upon the head and down
the back. This form of decoration is not absolutely necessary, as the
expense of the “war bonnet” places it beyond the reach of the greater
number of persons.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with the explanation of the
<ins class="correction" title="so in original: word is usually written ‘Midē´’">Mide´</ins> records it
may be of interest to quote the traditions relative to the migration of
the Ani´shinâ´bēg, as obtained by Mr. Warren previous to 1853. In his
reference to observing the rites of initiation he heard one of the
officiating priests deliver “a loud and spirited harangue,” of which the
following words<a class="tag" name="tag126" id="tag126" href="#note126">126</a> caught his attention:</p>

<blockquote><ins class="correction" title="open quote missing">“</ins>Our forefathers
were living on the great salt water
toward the rising sun, the great Megis (seashell) showed itself above
the surface of the great water and the rays of the sun for a long time
period were reflected from its glossy back. It gave warmth and light to
the An-ish-in-aub-ag (red race). All at once it sank into the deep, and
for a time our ancestors were not blessed with its light. It rose to the
surface and appeared again on the great river which drains the waters of
the Great Lakes, and again for a long time it gave life to our
forefathers and reflected back the rays of the sun. Again it disappeared
from sight and it rose not till it appeared to the eyes of the
An-ish-in-aub-ag on the shores of the first great lake. Again it sank
from sight, and death daily visited the wigiwams of our forefathers till
it showed its back and reflected the rays of the sun once more at
Bow-e-ting (Sault Ste. Marie). Here it remained for a long time, but
once more, and for the last time, it disappeared, and the
An-ish-in-aub-ag was left in darkness and misery, till it floated and
once more showed its bright back at Mo-ning-wun-a-kaun-ing (La Pointe
Island), where it has ever since reflected back the rays of the sun and
blessed our ancestors with life, light, and wisdom. Its rays reach the
remotest village of the widespread Ojibways.” As the old man delivered
this talk he continued to display the shell, which he represented as an
emblem of the great megis of which he was speaking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A few days after, anxious to learn the true meaning of this
allegory,<span class="pad1"> ***</span>I requested him to explain to
me the meaning of his Me-da-we harangue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After filling his pipe and smoking of the tobacco I had
presented he proceeded to give me the desired information, as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“My grandson,” said he, “the megis I spoke of means the
Me-da-we religion. Our forefathers, many string of lives ago, lived on
the shores of the great salt water in the east. Here, while they were
suffering the ravages of sickness and death, the Great Spirit, at the
intercession of Man-a-bo-sho, the great common uncle of the
An-ish-in-aub-ag, granted them this rite, wherewith life is restored and
prolonged. Our forefathers moved from the shores of the great water and
proceeded westward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Me-da-we lodge was pulled down, and it was not again
erected till our forefathers again took a stand on the shores of the
great river where Mo-ne-aung (Montreal) now stands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the course of time this town was again deserted, and our
forefathers, still
<span class="pagenum">184</span>
<a name="page184" id="page184"> </a>
<!--png 244-->
proceeding westward, lit not their fires till they reached the shores of
Lake Huron, where again the rites of the Me-da-we were
practiced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Again these rites were forgotten, and the Me-da-we lodge
was not built till the Ojibways found themselves congregated at
Bow-e-ting (outlet of Lake Superior), where it remained for many
winters. Still the Ojibways moved westward, and for the last time the
Me-da-we lodge was erected on the island of La Pointe, and here, long
before the pale face appeared among them, it was practiced in its purest
and most original form. Many of our fathers lived the full term of life
granted to mankind by the Great Spirit, and the forms of many old people
were mingled with each rising generation. This, my grandson, is the
meaning of the words you did not understand; they have been repeated to
us by our fathers for many generations.”</blockquote>

<p>In the explanation of the chart obtained at Red Lake, together with
the tradition, reference to the otter, as being the most sacred emblem
of society, is also verified in a brief notice of a tradition by Mr.
Warren,<a class="tag" name="tag127" id="tag127" href="#note127">127</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>There is another tradition told by the old men of the
Ojibway village of Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, which tells of their
former residence on the shores of the great salt water. It is, however,
so similar in character to the one I have related that its introduction
here would only occupy unnecessary space. The only difference between
the two traditions is that the otter, which is emblematical of one of
the four Medicine Spirits who are believed to preside over the Midawe
rites, is used in one in the same figurative manner as the seashell is
used in the other, first appearing to the ancient An-ish-in-aub-ag from
the depths of the great salt water, again on the river St. Lawrence,
then on Lake Huron at Sault Ste. Marie, again at La Pointe, but lastly
at Fond du Lac, or end of Lake Superior, where it is said to have forced
the sand bank at the mouth of the St. Louis River. The place is still
pointed out by the Indians where they believe the great otter broke
through.</blockquote>

<p>It is affirmed by the Indians that at Sault Ste. Marie some of the
Ojibwa separated from the main body of that tribe and traversed the
country along the northern shore of Lake Superior toward the west.
These have since been known of as the “Bois <ins class="correction"
title="now spelled ‘Forte’, but ‘Forts’ is common in early texts">Forts</ins>” (hardwood people or timber
people), other bands being located at Pigeon River, Rainy Lake, etc.
Another separation occurred at La Pointe, one party going toward Fond du
Lac and westward to Red Lake, where they claim to have resided for more
than three hundred years, while the remainder scattered from La Pointe
westward and southwestward, locating at favorable places throughout the
timbered country. This early dismemberment and long-continued separation
of the Ojibwa nation accounts, to a considerable extent, for the several
versions of the migration and the sacred emblems connected with the
Midē´wiwin, the northern bands generally maintaining their faith in
favor of the Otter as the guide, while the southern bodies are almost
entirely supporters of the belief in the great mī´gis.</p>

<p>On account of the independent operations of the Midē´ priests in the
various settlements of the Ojibwa, and especially because of the slight
intercourse between those of the northern and southern divisions of the
nation, there has arisen a difference in the pictographic
<span class="pagenum">185</span>
<a name="page185" id="page185"> </a>
<!--png 245-->
representation of the same general ideas, variants which are frequently
not recognized by Midē´ priests who are not members of the Midē´wiwin in
which these mnemonic charts had their origin. As there are variants in
the pictographic delineation of originally similar ideas, there are also
corresponding variations in the traditions pertaining to them.</p>

from Ki´tshi Man´idō for the Ani´shinâ´bēg is illustrated in <a href="#fig6">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>, which is a reproduction of a chart preserved at
White Earth. The record is read from left to right. No. 1 represents
Mi´nabō´zho, who says of the adjoining characters representing the
members of the Midē´wiwin: “They are the ones, they are the ones, who
put into my heart the life.” Mi´nabō´zho holds in his left hand the
sacred Midē´ sack, or pin-ji´-gu-sân´. Nos. 2 and 3 represent the
drummers. At the sound of the drum all the Midē´ rise and become
inspired, because Ki´tshi Man´idō is then present in the wig´iwam. No. 4
denotes that women also have the privilege of becoming members of the
Midē´wiwin. The figure holds in the left hand the Midē´ sack, made of a
snake skin. No. 5 represents the Tortoise, the guardian spirit who was
the giver of some of the sacred objects used in the rite. No. 6, the
Bear, also a benevolent Man´idō, but not held in so great veneration as
the Tortoise. His tracks are visible in the Midē´wiwin. No. 7, the
sacred Midē´ sack or pin-ji´-gu-sân´, which contains life, and can be
used by the Midē´ to prolong the life of a sick person. No. 8 represents
a Dog, given by the Midē´ Man´idōs to Mi´nabō´zho as a companion.</p>

<p>Such was the interpretation given by the owner of the chart, but the
informant was unconsciously in error, as has been ascertained not only
from other Midē´ priests consulted with regard to the true meaning, but
also in the light of later information and research in the
exemplification of the ritual of the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>Mi´nabō´zho did not receive the rite from any Midē´ priests (Nos. 2
and&nbsp;5), but from Ki´tshi Man´idō. Women are not mentioned in any of
the earlier traditions of the origin of the society, neither was the dog
given to Mi´nabō´zho, but Mi´nabō´zho gave it to the Ani´shinâ´bēg.</p>

<p>The chart, therefore, turns out to be a mnemonic song similar to
others to be noted hereafter, and the owner probably copied it from
<span class="pagenum">186</span>
<a name="page186" id="page186"> </a>
<!--png 246-->
a chart in the possession of a stranger Midē´, and failed to learn its
true signification, simply desiring it to add to his collection of
sacred objects and to gain additional respect from his confrères and
admirers.</p>

<p>Two similar and extremely old birch-bark mnemonic songs were found in
the possession of a Midē´ at Red Lake. The characters upon these are
almost identical, one appearing to be a copy of the other. These are
reproduced in Figs. <a href="#fig7">7</a> and <a href="#fig7">8</a>.
By some of the Midē´ Esh´gibō´ga takes the place of Mi´nabō´zho as
having originally received the Midē´wiwin from Ki´tshi Man´idō, but it
is believed that the word is a synonym or a substitute based upon some
reason to them inexplicable. These figures were obtained in 1887, and a
brief explanation of them given in the American Anthropologist.<a class="tag" name="tag128" id="tag128" href="#note128">128</a> At that time
I could obtain but little direct information from the owners of the
records, but it has since been ascertained that both are mnemonic songs
pertaining to Mi´nabō´zho, or rather Eshgibō´ga, and do not form a part
of the sacred records of the Midē´wiwin, but simply the pictographic
representation of the possibilities and powers of the alleged religion.
The following explanation of Figs. <a href="#fig7">7</a> and <a href="#fig8">8</a> is reproduced from the work just cited. A few annotations

MIDĒ´WIGÂN.</a></h5>

<p>Initiation into the Midē´wiwin or Midē´ Society is, at this time,
performed during the latter part of summer. The ceremonies are performed
in public, as the structure in which they are conducted is often loosely
constructed of poles with intertwined branches and leaves, leaving the
top almost entirely exposed, so that there is no difficulty in observing
what may transpire within. Furthermore, the ritual is unintelligible to
the uninitiated, and the important part of the necessary information is
given to the candidate in a preceptor’s wig´iwam.</p>

<p>To present intelligibly a description of the ceremonial of initiation
as it occurred at White Earth, Minnesota, it will be necessary to first
describe the structure in which it occurs, as well as the sweat lodge
with which the candidate has also to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p>The Midē´wigân, i.e., Midē´wig´iwam, or, as it is generally
designated “Grand Medicine Lodge,” is usually built in an open grove or
clearing; it is a structure measuring about 80 feet in length by 20 in
width, extending east and west with the main entrance toward that point
of the compass at which the sun rises. The walls consist of poles and
saplings from 8 to 10 feet high, firmly planted in the ground, wattled
with short branches and twigs with leaves. In the east and west walls
are left open spaces, each about 4 feet wide,
<span class="pagenum">188</span>
<a name="page188" id="page188"> </a>
<!--png 248-->
used as entrances to the inclosure. From each side of the opening the
wall-like structure extends at right angles to the end wall, appearing
like a short hallway leading to the inclosure, and resembles double
doors opened outward. <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a> represents a ground
plan of the Midē´wigân, while <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a> shows an
interior view. Saplings thrown across the top of the structure serve as
rafters, upon which are laid branches with leaves, and pieces of bark,
to sufficiently shade the occupants from the rays of the sun. Several
saplings extend across the inclosure near the top, while a few are
attached to these so as to extend longitudinally, from either side of
which presents of blankets, etc., may be suspended. About 10 feet from
the main entrance a large flattened stone, measuring more than a foot in
diameter, is placed upon the ground. This is used when subjecting to
treatment a patient; and at a corresponding distance from the western
door is planted the sacred Midē´ post of cedar, that for the first
degree being about 7 feet in height and 6 or 8 inches in diameter. It is
painted red, with a band of green 4 inches wide around the top. Upon the
post is fixed the stuffed body of an owl. Upon that part of the floor
midway between the stone and the Midē´ post is spread a blanket, upon
which the gifts and presents to the society are afterward deposited. A
short distance from each of the outer angles of the structure are
planted cedar or pine trees, each about 10 feet in height.</p>

About a hundred yards east of the main entrance is constructed a
wig´iwam or sweat lodge, to be used by the candidate, both to take his
vapor baths and to receive final instructions from his preceptor.</p>

<p>This wig´iwam is dome-shaped<ins class="correction"
title="so in original: ‘and measures’, ‘measuring’?"> measures</ins>
about 10 feet in
diameter and 6 feet high in the middle, with an opening at the top which
can be readily covered with a piece of bark. The framework of the
structure consists of saplings stuck into the ground, the tops being
bent over to meet others from the opposite side. Other thin saplings are
then lashed horizontally to the upright ones so as to appear like hoops,
decreasing in size as the summit is reached. They are secured by using
strands of basswood bark. The whole is then covered with pieces of
birchbark&mdash;frequently the bark of the pine is used&mdash;leaving a
narrow opening on the side facing the Midē´wigân, which may be closed
with an adjustable flap of bark or blankets.</p>

<p>The space between the Midē´wigân and the sweat lodge must be kept
clear of other temporary shelters, which might be placed there by some
of the numerous visitors attending the ceremonies.</p>


<h4 class="section"><a name="first" id="first">FIRST

<h5><a name="first_prep" id="first_prep">
PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>When the candidate’s application for reception into the Midē´wiwin
has been received by one of the officiating priests, he calls upon the
three assisting Midē´, inviting them to visit him at his own wig´iwam at
a specified time. When the conference takes place, tobacco, which has
been previously furnished by the candidate, is distributed and a smoke
offering made to Ki´tshi Man´idō, to propitiate his favor in the
deliberations about to be undertaken. The host then explains the object
of the meeting, and presents to his auditors an account of the
candidate’s previous life; he recounts the circumstances of his fast and
dreams, and if the candidate is to take the place of a lately deceased
son who had been prepared to receive the degree, the fact is mentioned,
as under such circumstances the forms would be different from the
ordinary method of reception into the society. The subject of presents
and gifts to the individual members of the society, as well as those
intended to be given as a fee to the officiating priests, is also
discussed; and lastly, if all things are favorable to the applicant, the
selection of an instructor or preceptor is made, this person being
usually appointed from among these four priests.</p>

<p>When the conference is ended the favorable decision is announced to
the applicant, who acknowledges his pleasure by remitting to each of the
four priests gifts of tobacco. He is told what instructor would be most
acceptable to them, when he repairs to the wig´iwam of the person
designated and informs him of his wish and the decision of the Midē´
council.</p>

<p>The designated preceptor arranges with his pupil to have certain days
upon which the latter is to call and receive instruction and acquire
<span class="pagenum">190</span>
<a name="page190" id="page190"> </a>
<!--png 250-->
information. The question of remuneration being settled, tobacco is
furnished at each sitting, as the Midē´ never begins his lecture until
after having made a smoke-offering, which is done by taking a whiff and
pointing the stem to the east; then a whiff, directing the stem to the
south; another whiff, directing the stem to the west; then a whiff and a
similar gesture with the stem to the north; another whiff is taken
slowly and with an expression of reverence, when the stem is pointed
forward and upward as an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō; and finally, after
taking a similar whiff, the stem is pointed forward and downward toward
the earth as an offering to Nokō´mis, the grandmother of the universe,
and to those who have passed before. After these preliminaries, the
candidate receives at each meeting only a small amount of information,
because the longer the instruction is continued daring the season before
the meeting at which it is hoped the candidate may be admitted the
greater will be the fees; and also, in order that the instruction may be
looked upon with awe and reverence, most of the information imparted is
frequently a mere repetition, the ideas being clothed in ambiguous
phraseology. The Midē´ drum (<a href="#fig12">Fig.
12&nbsp;<i>a</i></a>) differs from the drum commonly used in dances (<a
href="#fig12">Fig. 12&nbsp;<i>b</i></a>) in the fact that it is
cylindrical, consisting of an elongated kettle or wooden vessel, or
perhaps a section of the hollow trunk of a tree about 10 inches in
diameter and from 18 to 20 inches in length, over both ends of which
rawhide is stretched while wet, so that upon drying the membrane becomes
hard and tense, producing, when beaten, a very hard, loud tone, which
may be heard at a great distance.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, water is put into the bottom of the drum and the
drum-head stretched across the top in a wet state, which appears to
intensify the sound very considerably.</p>

<p>The peculiar and special properties of the drum are described to the
applicant; that it was at first the gift of Ki´tshi Man´idō, who gave it
through the intercession of Mi´nabō´zho; that it is used to invoke the
presence of the Midē´ Man´idōs, or sacred spirits, when seeking
<span class="pagenum">191</span>
<a name="page191" id="page191"> </a>
<!--png 251-->
direction as to information desired, success, etc.; that it is to be
employed at the side of the sick to assist in the expulsion or exorcism
of evil man´idōs who may possess the body of the sufferer; and that it
is to be used in the. Midē´wigân during the initiation of new members or
the advancement of a Midē´ from a degree to a higher one.</p>

<p>The properties of the rattle are next enumerated and recounted, its
origin is related, and its uses explained. It is used at the side of a
patient and has even more power in the expulsion of evil demons than the
drum. The rattle is also employed in some of the sacred songs as an
accompaniment, to accentuate certain notes and words. There are two
forms used, one consisting of a cylindrical tin box filled with grains
of corn or other seeds (<a href="#fig13">Fig.&nbsp;13</a>), the other
being a hollow gourd also filled with seed (<a href="#fig14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). In both of these the handle passes entirely
through the rattle case.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the remaining gifts of Mi´nabō´zho are instanced
and their properties extolled.</p>

<p>The mī´gis, a small white shell (Cypræa moneta&nbsp;L.) is next
extracted from the Midē´ sack, or pinji´gusân´. This is explained as
being the sacred emblem of the Midē´wiwin, the reason therefor being
given in the account of the several traditions presented in connection
with Pls. <span class="smallroman">III</span>, <span class="smallroman">IV</span>, and <span class="smallroman">VIII</span>. This
information is submitted in parts, so that the narrative of the history
connected with either of the records is extended over a period of time
to suit the preceptor’s plans and purposes. The ceremony of shooting the
mī´gis (see <a href="#fig15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>) is explained on page
<ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘192’ (page number of Fig.&nbsp;15)">215</ins>.</p>

<p>As time progresses the preceptor instructs his pupil in Midē´ songs,
i.e., he sings to him songs which form a part of his stock in trade, and
which are alleged to be of service on special occasions, as when
searching for medicinal plants, hunting, etc. The pupil thus acquires a
comprehension of the method of preparing and reciting songs, which
information is by him subsequently put to practical use in the
composition and preparation of his own songs, the mnemonic characters
employed being often rude copies of those observed upon the charts of
his preceptor, but the arrangement thereof being original.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that a Midē´ is seldom, if ever, able to recite
correctly any songs but his own, although he may be fully aware of the
character of the record and the particular class of service in which it
may be employed. In support of this assertion several songs obtained at
Red Lake and imperfectly explained by “Little Frenchman” and “Leading
Feather,” are reproduced in <a href="#plateXXIIa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XXII</span>,&nbsp;A</a> <a href="#plateXXIIb">B</a>, page
292.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">192</span>
<a name="page192" id="page192"> </a>
<!--png 252-->
From among the various songs given by my preceptor are selected and
presented herewith those recognized by him as being part of the ritual.
The greater number of songs are mere repetitions of short phrases, and
frequently but single words, to which are added meaningless sounds or
syllables to aid in prolonging the musical tones, and repeated ad
libitum in direct proportion to the degree of inspiration in which the
singer imagines himself to have attained. These frequent outbursts of
singing are not based upon connected mnemonic songs preserved upon birch
bark, but they consist of fragments or selections of songs which have
been memorized, the selections relating to the subject upon which the
preceptor has been discoursing, and which undoubtedly prompts a rythmic
vocal equivalent. These songs are reproduced on Pl. <span class="smallroman">IX</span>, <a href="#plateIXa">A,</a> <a href="#plateIXb">B,</a>&nbsp;<a href="#plateIXc">C</a>. The initial
mnemonic characters pertaining to each word or phrase of the original
text are repeated below in regular order with translations in English,
together with supplemental notes explanatory of the characters employed.
The musical notation is not presented, as the singing consists of a
monotonous repetition of four or five notes in a minor key; furthermore,
a sufficiently clear idea of this may be formed by comparing some of the
Midē´ songs presented in connection with the ritual of initiation and
preparation of medicines. The first of the songs given herewith (<a href="#plateIXa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">IX</span>,&nbsp;A</a>)
pertains to a request to Ki´tshi Man´idō that clear weather may be had
for the
<span class="pagenum">193</span>
<a name="page193" id="page193"> </a>
<!--png 255-->
day of ceremonial, and also an affirmation to the candidate that the
singer’s words are a faithful rendering of his creed.</p>

<p>Each of the phrases is repeated before advancing to the next, as
often as the singer desires and in proportion to the amount of reverence
and awe with which he wishes to impress his hearer. There is usually a
brief interval between each of the phrases, and a longer one at the
appearance of a vertical line, denoting a rest, or pause. One song may
occupy, therefore, from fifteen minutes to half an hour.</p>

from the Good Spirit; he has been blessed with knowledge of plants and

MIDĒ´ THERAPEUTICS.</a></h5>

<p>During the period of time in which the candidate is instructed in the
foregoing traditions, myths, and songs the subject of Midē´ plants is
also discussed. The information pertaining to the identification and
preparation of the various vegetable substances is not imparted in
regular order, only one plant or preparation, or perhaps two, being
enlarged upon at a specified consultation. It may be that the candidate
is taken into the woods where it is known that a specified plant or tree
may be found, when a smoke offering is made before the object is pulled
out of the soil, and a small pinch of tobacco put into the hole in the
ground from which it was taken. This is an offering to
Noko´mis&mdash;the earth, the grandmother of mankind&mdash;for the
benefits which are derived from her body where they were placed by
Ki´tshi Man´idō.</p>

<p>In the following list are presented, as far as practicable, the
botanical and common names of these, there being a few instances in
which the plants were not to be had, as they were foreign to that
portion of Minnesota in which the investigations were made; a few of
them, also, were not identified by the preceptors, as they were out of
season.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this list the number of infusions and
decoctions which are, from a medical and scientific standpoint, specific
remedies for the complaints for which they are recommended. It is
probable that the long continued intercourse between the Ojibwa and the
Catholic Fathers, who were tolerably well versed in the ruder forms of
medication, had much to do with improving an older and purely aboriginal
form of practicing medical magic. In some of the remedies mentioned
below there may appear to be philosophic reasons for their
administration, but upon closer investigation it has been learned that
the cure is not attributed to a regulation or restoration of functional
derangement, but to the removal or even expulsion of malevolent
beings&mdash;commonly designated as bad Man´idōs&mdash;supposed to have
taken possession of that part of the body in which such derangement
appears most conspicuous. Further reference to the mythic properties of
some of the plants employed will be made at the proper time.</p>

<p>Although the word Mashki kiwa´bu<sup>n</sup>&mdash;medicine
broth&mdash;signifies liquid medical preparations, the term is usually
employed in a general sense to pertain to the entire materia medica; and
in addition to the alleged medicinal virtues extolled by the preceptors,
certain parts of the trees and plants enumerated are eaten on account of
some mythic reason, or employed in the construction or manufacture of
habitations, utensils, and weapons, because of some supposed
supernatural origin or property, an explanation of which they have
forgotten.</p>

<p>It is affirmed by various members of the Midē´ Society that in former
times much of the information relating to some of these plants was not
imparted to a candidate for initiation into the first degree, but was
reserved for succeeding degrees, to induce a Midē´ of the first degree
to endeavor to attain higher distinction and further advancement in the
mysteries of the order. As much knowledge
<span class="pagenum">202</span>
<a name="page202" id="page202"> </a>
<!--png 264-->
is believed to have been lost through the reticence and obstinacy of
former chief priests, the so-called higher secrets are now imparted at
the first and second degree preparatory instructions. The third and
fourth degrees are very rarely conferred, chiefly because the necessary
presents and fees are beyond the reach of those who so desire
advancement, and partly also because the missionaries, and in many
instances the Indian agents, have done their utmost to suppress the
ceremonies, because they were a direct opposition and hindrance to
progress in Christianizing influences.</p>

<p>When the preparatory instruction has come to an end and the day of
the ceremony of initiation is at hand, the preceptor sings to his pupil
a song, expatiating upon his own efforts and the high virtue of the
knowledge imparted. The pipe is brought forward and an offering of
tobacco smoke made by both preceptor and pupil, after which the former
sings a song (<a href="#plateXa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">X</span>,&nbsp;A</a>.), the time of its utterance being
tediously prolonged. The mnemonic characters were drawn by Sikas´sigĕ,
and are a copy of an old birch-bark scroll which has for many years been
in his possession, and which was made in imitation of one in the
possession of his father, Baiē´dzĭk, one of the leading Midē´ at Mille
Lacs, Minnesota.</p>

<p>From ten days to two weeks before the day of initiation, the chief
Midē´ priest sends out to all the members invitations, which consist of
sticks one-fourth of an inch thick and 6 or 7 inches long. The courier
is charged with giving to the person invited explicit information as to
the day of the ceremony and the locality where it is to
<span class="pagenum">204</span>
<a name="page204" id="page204"> </a>
<!--png 268-->
be held. Sometimes these sticks have bands of color painted around one
end, usually green, sometimes red, though both colors may be employed,
the two ends being thus tinted. The person invited is obliged to bring
with him his invitation stick, and upon entering the Midē´wigân he lays
it upon the ground near the sacred stone, on the side toward the degree
post. In case a Midē´ is unable to attend he sends his invitation with a
statement of the reason of his inability to come. The number of sticks
upon the floor are counted, on the morning of the day of initiation, and
the number of those present to attend the ceremonies is known before the
initiation begins.</p>

<p>About five or six days preceding the day set for the ceremony of
initiation, the candidate removes to the neighborhood of the locality of
the Midē´wigân. On the evening of the fifth day he repairs to the
sudatory or sweat-lodge, which has, in the meantime, been built east of
the sacred inclosure, and when seated within he is supplied with water
which he keeps for making vapor by pouring it upon heated stones
introduced for the purpose by assistants upon the outside. This act of
purification is absolutely necessary and must be performed once each day
for four days, though the process may be shortened by taking two vapor
baths in one day, thus limiting the process to two days. This, however,
is permitted, or desired only under extraordinary circumstances. During
the process of purgation, the candidates thoughts must dwell upon the
seriousness of the course he is pursuing and the sacred character of the
new life he is about to assume.</p>

<p>When the fumigation has ceased he is visited by the preceptor and the
other officiating Midē´ priests, when the conversation is confined
chiefly to the candidate’s progress. He then gives to each of them
presents of tobacco, and after an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō, with the
pipe, they expose the articles contained in their Midē´ sacks and
explain and expatiate upon the merits and properties of each of the
magic objects. The candidate for the first time learns of the manner of
preparing effigies, etc., with which to present to the incredulous
ocular demonstration of the genuineness and divine origin of the
Midē´wiwin, or, as it is in this connection termed, religion.</p>

<p>Several methods are employed for the purpose, and the greater the
power of the Midē´ the greater will appear the mystery connected with
the exhibition. This may be performed whenever circumstances demand such
proof, but the tests are made before the candidate with a twofold
purpose: first, to impress him with the supernatural powers of the Midē´
themselves; and second, in an oracular manner, to ascertain if Ki´tshi
Ma´nidō is pleased with the contemplated ceremony and the initiation of
the candidate.</p>

<p>The first test is made by laying upon the floor of the wig´iwam a
string of four wooden beads each measuring about 1 inch in diameter. See
<a href="#fig16">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>. After the owner of this object has
chanted for a few moments in an almost inaudible manner the beads begin
to roll from side to side as if animated. The string is then quickly
restored to its place in the Midē´ sack. Another Midē´ produces a small
wooden effigy of a man (<a href="#fig17">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>), measuring
about 5 inches in height. The body has a small orifice running through
it from between the shoulders to the buttocks, the head and neck forming
a separate piece which may be attached to the body like a glass stopper
to a bottle.</p>

<p>A hole is made in the ground deep enough to reach to the hips of the
effigy, when the latter is put into it and the loose earth loosely
restored so as to hold it in an upright position. Some magic powder of
herbs is sprinkled around the body, and into the vertical orifice in
<span class="pagenum">206</span>

it, when the head is put in place. A series of inarticulate utterances
are chanted, when, if everything be favorable, the figure will
perceptibly move up and down as if possessed of life. <a href="#fig18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a> represents another figure used in a similar
manner. It consists of one piece, however, and is decorated with narrow
bands of dark blue flannel about the ankles and knees, a patch of red
cloth upon the breast and bands about the wrists, each of the eyes being
indicated by three white porcelain beads.</p>

<p>One of the most astonishing tests, however, and one that can be
produced only by Midē´ of the highest power, consists in causing a Midē´
sack to move upon the ground as if it were alive. This, it is
confidently alleged, has been done repeatedly, though it is evident that
the deception is more easily produced than in the above-mentioned
instances, as the temporary retention within a bag of a small mammal
could readily be made to account for the movements.</p>

<p>In most of these private exhibitions the light is so obscured as to
prevent the deception being observed and exposed; and when public
demonstrations of skill are made the auditors invariably consist of the
most credulous of the uninitiated, or the confréres of the performer,
from whom no antagonism or doubt would be expected.</p>

<p>The preceptor then consults with the Midē´ priests respecting the
presents to be delivered by the candidate, and repeats the following
words, viz:</p>

<p>When the four vapor baths have been taken by the candidate, and the
eve of the ceremony has arrived, he remains in the sudatory longer than
usual so as not to come in contact with the large crowd of visitors who
have arrived upon the scene. The woods resound with the noises incident
to a large camp, while in various directions may be heard the monotonous
beating of the drum indicating the presence of a number of dancers, or
the hard, sharp taps of the midē´ drum, caused by a priest propitiating
and invoking the presence and favor of Ki´tshi Ma´nidō in the service
now so near at hand.</p>

<p>When the night is far advanced and all becomes hushed, the candidate,
with only the preceptor accompanying, retires to his own wig´iwam, while
the assistant Midē´ priests and intimate friends or members of his
family collect the numerous presents and suspend them from the
transverse and longitudinal poles in the upper part of the Midē´wigân.
Watchers remain to see that nothing is removed during the night.</p>

<p>At the approach of day, the candidate breakfasts and again returns to
the sweat-lodge to await the coming of his preceptor, and, later, of the
officiating priests. The candidate puts on his best clothing
<span class="pagenum">207</span>
<a name="page207" id="page207"> </a>
<!--png 271-->
and such articles of beaded ornaments as he may possess. The preceptor
and Midē´ priests are also clad in their finest apparel, each wearing
one or two beaded dancing bags at his side, secured by a band of beaded
cloth crossing the opposite shoulder. The members of the Midē´wiwin who
are not directly concerned in the preliminaries resort to the Midē´wigân
and take seats around the interior, near the wall, where they may
continue to smoke, or may occasionally drum and sing. The drummer, with
his assistants, takes a place near upon the floor of the sacred
inclosure to the left of the eastern entrance, i.e., the southeast
corner.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="weather" id="weather">
IMPLORATION FOR CLEAR WEATHER.</a></h5>

<p>Should the day open up with a threatening sky, one of the Midē´
priests accompanying the candidate sings the following song (<a href="#plateXb">Pl. <span class="smallroman">X</span>,&nbsp;B</a>) to
dispel the clouds. Each of the lines is repeated an indefinite number of
times, and after being repeated once or twice is sung also by the others
as an accompaniment.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the words as spoken vary to some extent when
chanted or sung.</p>

<p>In case the appearance of the sky becomes sufficiently favorable the
initiation begins, but if it should continue to be more unfavorable or
to rain, then the song termed the “Rain Song” is resorted to and sung
within the inclosure of the Midē´wigân, to which they all march in
solemn procession. Those Midē´ priests who have with them their Midē´
drums use them as an accompaniment to the singing and to propitiate the
good will of Ki´tshi Man´idō. Each line of the entire song appears as an
independent song, the intervals of rest varying in time according to the
feelings of the officiating priest.</p>

<p>The words of the song are known to most of the Midē´ priests; but, as
there is no method of retaining a set form of musicial notation, the
result is entirely individual and may vary with each singer, if sung
independently and out of hearing of others; so that, under
<span class="pagenum">210</span>

ordinary circumstances, the priest who leads off sings through one
stanza of the song, after which the others will readily catch the notes
and accompany him. It will be observed, also, that the words as spoken
vary to some extent when chanted or sung.</p>

<p>If this song does not appear to bring about a favorable change the
priests return to their respective wig´iwams and the crowd of visitors
disperses to return upon the first clear day.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="first_init" id="first_init">

to the sweat-lodge, where he is joined by his preceptor, and later by
the officiating priest. After all preliminaries have been arranged and
the proper time for regular proceedings has arrived, the preceptor sings
the following song (<a href="#plateXc">Pl. <span class="smallroman">X</span>,&nbsp;C</a>), the musical notation of which varies
according to his feelings, clearly showing that there is no recognized

<p>The Midē´ priests then leave the sweat-lodge and stand upon the
outside, while the candidate gathers up in his arms a number of small
presents, such as tobacco, handkerchiefs, etc., and goes out of the
wig´iwam to join the Midē´ priests. The order of marching to the main
entrance of the Midē´wigân is then taken up in the following order:
First the candidate, next the preceptor, who in turn is followed by the
officiating priests, and such others, and members of his family and
relatives as desire. At the door of the Midē´wigân all but one of the
priests continue forward and take their stations within the inclosure,
the preceptor remaining on one side of the candidate, the Midē´ priest
upon the other, then all march four times around the outside of the
inclosure, toward the left or south, during which time drumming is
continued within. Upon the completion of the fourth circuit the
candidate is placed so as to face the main entrance of the Midē´wigân.
When he is prompted to say:</p>

<p>The presents are then laid upon the ground. The preceptor goes
inside, taking with him the gifts deposited by the candidate, and
remains standing just within the door and faces the degree post toward
the west. Then the chief officiating priest, who has remained at the
side of the candidate, turns toward the latter and in a clear, distinct,
and exceedingly impressive manner sings the following chant, addressed
to Ki´tshi Man´idō whose invisible form is supposed to abide within the
Midē´wigan during such ceremonies, stating that the candidate is
presented to receive life (the mī´gis) for which he is suffering, and
invoking the divine favor.</p>

<p>The candidate is then led within the inclosure when all the members
of the society arise while he is slowly led around toward the southern
side to the extreme end in the west, thence toward the right and back
along the western side to the point of beginning. This is done four
times. As he starts upon his march, the member nearest the door falls in
the line of procession, each member continuing to drop in, at the rear,
until the entire assembly is in motion. During this movement there is a
monotonous drumming upon the Midē´ drums and the chief officiating
priest sings:</p>

<p>At the fourth circuit, members begin to stop at the places previously
occupied by them, the candidate going and remaining with his preceptor
to a point just inside the eastern entrance, while the four officiating
priests continue around toward the opposite end of the inclosure and
station themselves in a semicircle just beyond the degree post, and
facing the western door. Upon the ground before them are spread blankets
and similar goods, which have been removed from the beams above, and
upon which the candidate is to kneel. He is then led to the western
extremity of the inclosure where he

stands upon the blankets spread upon the ground and faces the four Midē´
priests. The preceptor takes his position behind and a little to one
side of the candidate, another assistant being called upon by the
preceptor to occupy a corresponding position upon the other side. During
this procedure there is gentle drumming which ceases after all have been
properly stationed, when the preceptor steps to a point to the side and
front of the candidate and nearer the officiating priests, and says:</p>

<p>The preceptor then returns to his position back of and a little to

following song, accompanying himself upon a small cylindrical midē´drum.

shall hear me, spirit that you are&mdash;, and the music is rendered as

After this song is ended the drum is handed to one of the members
sitting near by, when the fourth and last of the officiating priests
says to the candidate, who is now placed upon his knees:</p>

</table>

<p>This priest then grasps his Midē´ sack as if holding a gun, and,
clutching it near the top with the left hand extended, while with the
right he clutches it below the middle or near the base, he aims it
toward the candidate’s left breast and makes a thrust forward toward
that target uttering the syllables “yâ, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,”
rapidly, rising to a higher key. He recovers his first position and
repeats this movement three times, becoming more and more animated, the
last time making a vigorous gesture toward the kneeling man’s breast as
if shooting him. (See <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>, page 192.) While
this is going on, the preceptor and his assistants place their hands
upon the candidate’s shoulders and cause his body to tremble.</p>

<p>Then the next Midē´, the third of the quartette, goes through a
similar series of forward movements and thrusts with his Midē´ sack,
uttering similar sounds and shooting the sacred
mī´gis&mdash;life&mdash;into the right breast of the candidate, who is
agitated still more strongly than before. When the third Midē´, the
second in order of precedence, goes through similar gestures and
pretends to shoot the mī´gis into the candidate’s heart, the preceptors
assist him to be violently agitated.</p>

<p>The leading priest now places himself in a threatening attitude and
says to the Midē´; “Mī´-dzhi-de´-a-mi-shĭk´”&mdash;“put your helping
heart with me”&mdash;, when he imitates his predecessors by saying, “yâ,
hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,” at the fourth time aiming the Midē´ sack
at the candidate’s head, and as the mī´gis is supposed to be shot into
it, he falls forward upon the ground, apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>Then the four Midē´ priests, the preceptor and the assistant, lay
their Midē´ sacks upon his back and after a few moments a mī´gis shell
drops from his mouth&mdash;where he had been instructed to retain it.
The chief Midē´ picks up the mī´gis and, holding it between the thumb
and index finger of the right hand, extending his arm toward the
candidate’s mouth says “wâ! wâ! hĕ hĕ hĕ hĕ,” the last syllable being
uttered in a high key and rapidly dropped to a low note; then the same
words are uttered while the mī´gis is held toward the east, and in
regular succession to the south, to the west, to the north, then toward
the sky. During this time the candidate has begun to partially revive
and endeavor to get upon his knees, but when the Midē´ finally places
the mī´gis into his mouth again, he instantly falls upon the ground, as
before. The Midē´ then take up the sacks, each grasping his own as
before, and as they pass around the inanimate body they touch it at
various points, which causes the
<span class="pagenum">216</span>
<a name="page216" id="page216"> </a>
<!--png 280-->
candidate to “return to life.” The chief priest then says to him,
“<ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘Ō´mishga‘n’">Ō´nishgân</ins>”&mdash;“get up”&mdash;which he does; then indicating to
the holder of the Midē´ drum to bring that to him, he begins tapping and
presently sings the following song:</p>

<p>and all go to such places as are made, or reserved, for them.</p>

<p>The new member then goes to the pile of blankets, robes, and other
gifts and divides them among the four officiating priests, reserving
some of less value for the preceptor and his assistant; whereas tobacco
is carried around to each person present. All then make an offering of
smoke, to the east, south, west, north, toward the center and top of the
Midē´wigân&mdash;where Ki´tshi Man´idō presides&mdash;and to the earth.
Then each person blows smoke upon his or her Midē´ sack as an offering
to the sacred mī´gis within.</p>

<p>The chief Midē´ advances to the new member and presents him with a
new Midē´ sack, made of an otter skin, or possibly of the skin of the
mink or weasel, after which he returns to his place. The new member
rises, approaches the chief Midē´, who inclines his head to the front,
and, while passing both flat hands down over either side,</p>

<table class="parallel" summary="line-by-line translation">

<tr class="gloss">

</tr>
</table>

<p>Then, approaching the next in rank, he repeats the ceremony and
continues to do so until he has made the entire circuit of the
Midē´wigân.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this ceremony of rendering thanks to the members
of the society for their presence, the newly elected Midē´ returns to
his place and, after placing within his Midē´ sack his mī´gis, starts
out anew to test his own powers. He approaches the person seated nearest
the eastern entrance, on the south side, and, grasping his sack in a
manner similar to that of the officiating priests, makes threatening
motions toward the Midē´ as if to shoot him, saying, “yâ, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,
hŏ´, hŏ´,” gradually raising his voice to a higher key. At the fourth
movement he makes a quick thrust toward his victim, whereupon the latter
falls forward upon the ground. He then proceeds to the next, who is
menaced in a similar manner and who likewise becomes apparently
unconscious from the powerful effects of the mī´gis. This is continued
until all persons present have been subjected to the influence of the
mī´gis in the possession of the new member. At the third or fourth
experiment the first subject revives and sits up, the others recovering
in regular order a short time after having been “shot at,” as this
procedure is termed.</p>

<p>When all of the Midē´ have recovered a very curious ceremony takes
place. Each one places his mī´gis shell upon the right palm and,
grasping the Midē´ sack with the left hand, moves around the inclosure
and exhibits his mī´gis to everyone present, constantly uttering the
word “hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,” in a quick, low tone. During this period
there is a mingling of all the persons present, each endeavoring to
attract the attention of the others. Each Midē´ then
<span class="pagenum">218</span>
<a name="page218" id="page218"> </a>
<!--png 282-->
pretends to swallow his mī´gis, when suddenly there are sounds of
violent coughing, as if the actors were strangling, and soon thereafter
they gag and spit out upon the ground the mī´gis, upon which each one
falls apparently dead. In a few moments, however, they recover, take up
the little shells again and pretend to swallow them. As the Midē´ return
to their respective places the mī´gis is restored to its receptacle in
the Midē´ sack.</p>

<p>Food is then brought into the Midē´wigân and all partake of it at the
expense of the new member.</p>

<p>After the feast, the older Midē´ of high order, and possibly the
officiating priests, recount the tradition of the Ani´shinâ´bēg and the
origin of the Midē´wiwin, together with speeches relating to the
benefits to be derived through a knowledge thereof, and sometimes, tales
of individual success and exploits. When the inspired ones have given
utterance to their thoughts and feelings, their memories and their
boastings, and the time of adjournment has almost arrived, the new
member gives an evidence of his skill as a singer and a Midē´. Having
acted upon the suggestion of his preceptor, he has prepared some songs
and learned them, and now for the first time the opportunity presents
itself for him to gain admirers and influential friends, a sufficient
number of whom he will require to speak well of him, and to counteract
the evil which will be spoken of him by enemies&mdash;for enemies are
numerous and may be found chiefly among those who are not fitted for the
society of the Midē´, or who have failed to attain the desired
distinction.</p>

<p>The new member, in the absence of a Midē´ drum of his own, borrows
one from a fellow Midē´ and begins to beat it gently, increasing the
strokes in intensity as he feels more and more inspired, then sings a
song (<a href="#plateXd">Pl. <span class="smallroman">X</span>,&nbsp;D</a>), of which the following are the
words, each line being repeated ad libitum, viz:</p>

<p>As the sun approaches the western horizon, the Midē´ priests emerge
from the western door of the Midē´wigân and go to their respective
wig´iwams, where they partake of their regular evening repast, after
which the remainder of the evening is spent in paying calls upon other
members of the society, smoking, etc.</p>

<p>The preceptor and his assistant return to the Midē´wigân at
nightfall, remove the degree post and plant it at the head of the
wig´iwam&mdash;that part directly opposite the entrance&mdash;occupied

<p>The mī´gis referred to in this description of the initiation consists
of a small white shell, of almost any species, but the one believed to
resemble the form of the mythical mī´gis is similar to the cowrie,
Cypræa moneta, L., and is figured at No. 1 on <a href="#plateXI">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">XI</span></a>. Nearly all
of the shells employed for this purpose are foreign species, and have no
doubt been obtained from the traders. The shells found in the country of
the Ojibwa are of rather delicate structure, and it is probable that the
salt water shells are employed as a substitute chiefly because of their
less frangible character. The mī´gis of the other degrees are presented
on the same plate, but special reference to them will be made. No. 2
represents the mī´gis in the possession of the chief Midē priest of the
society at Leech Lake, Minnesota, and consists of a pearl-white Helix
(sp?).</p>

<!--png 287-->
In <a href="#fig19">Fig.&nbsp;19</a> is reproduced a curious abnormal
growth which was in the possession of a Midē´ near Red Lake, Minnesota.
It consists of the leg of a Goshawk&mdash;Astur atricapillus,
Wilson&mdash;from the outer inferior condyle of the right tibia of which
had projected a supernumerary leg that terminated in two toes, the whole
abnormality being about one-half the size and length of the natural leg
and toes.</p>

<p>This fetish was highly prized by its former owner, and was believed
to be a medium whereby the favor of the Great Thunderer, or Thunder God,
might be invoked and his anger appeased. This deity is represented in
pictography by the eagle, or frequently by one of the Falconidæ; hence
it is but natural that the superstitious should look with awe and
reverence upon such an abnormality on one of the terrestrial
representatives of this deity.</p>

<p>A Midē´ of the first degree, who may not be enabled to advance
further in the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin, owing to his inability to
procure the necessary quantity of presents and gifts which he is
required to pay to new preceptors and to the officiating
priests&mdash;the latter demanding goods of double the value of those
given as an entrance to the first degree&mdash;may, however, accomplish
the acquisition of additional knowledge by purchasing it from individual
Midē´. It is customary with Midē´ priests to exact payment for every
individual remedy or secret that may be imparted to another who may
desire such information. This practice is not entirely based upon
mercenary motives, but it is firmly believed that when a secret or
remedy has been paid, for it can not be imparted for nothing, as then
its virtue would be impaired, if not entirely destroyed, by the man´idō
or guardian spirit under whose special protection it may be supposed to
be held or controlled.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances certain first degree Midē´ may become
possessed of alleged magic powers which are in reality part of the
accomplishments of the Midē´ of the higher degrees; but, for the mutual
protection of the members of the society, they generally hesitate to
impart anything that may be considered of high value. The usual kind of
knowledge sought consists of the magic properties and use of plants, to
the chief varieties of which reference will be made in connection with
the next degree.</p>

<p>There is one subject, however, which first-degree Midē´ seek
enlightment upon, and that is the preparation of the “hunter’s medicine”
and the pictographic drawings employed in connection therewith. The
compound is made of several plants, the leaves and roots of which are
ground into powder. A little of this is put into the gun barrel, with
the bullet, and sometimes a small pinch is dropped upon the track of the
animal to compel it to halt at whatever place it may be when the powder
is so sprinkled upon the ground.</p>

<p>The method generally employed to give to the hunter success is as
follows: When anyone contemplates making a hunting trip, he first visits
the Midē´, giving him a present of tobacco before announcing
<span class="pagenum">222</span>
<a name="page222" id="page222"> </a>
<!--png 288-->
the object of his visit and afterwards promising to give him such and
such portions of the animal which he may procure. The Midē´, if
satisfied with the gift, produces his pipe and after making an offering
to Ki´tshi Man´idō for aid in the preparation of his “medicine,” and to
appease the anger of the man´idō who controls the class of animals
desired, sings a song, one of his own composition, after which he will
draw with a sharp-pointed bone or nail, upon a small piece of birch
bark, the outline of the animal desired by the applicant. The place of
the heart of the animal is indicated by a puncture upon which a small
quantity of vermilion is carefully rubbed, this color being very
efficacious toward effecting the capture of the animal and the punctured
heart insuring its death.</p>

<p>Frequently the heart is indicated by a round or triangular figure,
from which a line extends toward the mouth, generally designated the
life line, i.e., that magic power may reach its heart and influence the
life of the subject designated. <a href="#fig20">Fig.&nbsp;20</a> is a
reproduction of the character drawn upon a small oval piece of birch
bark, which had been made by a Midē´ to insure the death of two bears.
Another example is presented in <a href="#fig21">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>, a
variety of animals being figured and a small quantity of vermilion being
rubbed upon the heart of each. In some instances the representation of
animal forms is drawn by the Midē´ not upon birch bark, but directly
upon sandy earth or a bed of ashes, either of which affords a smooth
surface. For this purpose he uses a sharply pointed piece of wood,
thrusts it into the region of the heart, and afterwards sprinkles upon
this a small quantity of powder consisting of magic plants and
vermilion. These performances are not conducted in public, but after the
regular mystic ceremony has been conducted by the Midē´ the information
is delivered with certain injunctions as to the course of procedure,
direction,
<span class="pagenum">223</span>
<a name="page223" id="page223"> </a>
<!--png 289-->
etc. In the latter method of drawing the outline upon the sand or upon
ashes, the result is made known with such directions as may be deemed
necessary to insure success.</p>

<p>For the purpose of gaining instruction and success in the disposition
of his alleged medicines, the Midē´ familiarizes himself with the
topography and characteristics of the country extending over a wide
area, to ascertain the best feeding grounds of the various animals and
their haunts at various seasons. He keeps himself informed by also
skillfully conducting inquiries of returning hunters, and thus becomes
possessed of a large amount of valuable information respecting the
natural history of the surrounding country, by which means he can, with
a tolerable amount of certainty, direct a hunter to the best localities
for such varieties of game as may be particularly desired by him.</p>

<p>In his incantations a Wâbĕnō´ uses a drum resembling a tambourine. A
hoop made of ash wood is covered with a piece of rawhide, tightly
stretched while wet. Upon the upper surface is painted a mythic figure,
usually that of his tutelaly daimon. An example of this kind is from Red
Lake, Minnesota, presented in <a href="#fig22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>. The
human figure is painted red, while the outline of the head is black, as
are also the waving lines extending from the head. These lines denote
superior power. When drumming upon this figure, the Wâbĕnō´ chants and
is thus more easily enabled to invoke the assistance of his man´idō.</p>

<p>Women, as before remarked, may take the degrees of the Midē´wiwin,
but, so far as could be ascertained, their professions pertain chiefly
to the treatment of women and children and to tattooing for the cure of
headache and chronic neuralgia.</p>

<p>Tattooing is accomplished by the use of finely powdered charcoal,
soot or gunpowder, the pricking instrument being made by tying together
a small number of needles; though formerly, it is said, fish spines or
sharp splinters of bone were used for the purpose. The marks consist of
round spots of one-half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter
immediately over the afflicted part, the intention being to drive out
the demon. Such spots are usually found upon the temples, though an
occasional one may be found on the forehead or over the nasal
eminence.</p>

<p>When the pain extends over considerable space the tattoo marks are
smaller, and are arranged in rows or continuous lines. Such marks may be
found upon some individuals to run outward over either or both cheeks
from the alæ of the nose to a point near the
<span class="pagenum">224</span>
<a name="page224" id="page224"> </a>
<!--png 290-->
lobe of the ear, clearly indicating that the tattooing was done for
toothache or neuralgia.</p>

<p>The female Midē´ is usually present at the initiation of new members,
but her duties are mainly to assist in the singing and to make herself
generally useful in connection with the preparation of the medicine
feast.</p>


<h4 class="section"><a name="second" id="second">SECOND
DEGREE.</a></h4>

<p>The inclosure within which the second degree of the Midē´wiwin is
conferred, resembles in almost every respect that of the first, the only
important difference being that there are two degree posts instead of
one. A diagram is presented in <a href="#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>. The
first post is planted a short distance beyond the middle of the
floor&mdash;toward the western door&mdash;and is similar to the post of
the first degree, i.e., red, with a band of green around the top, upon
which is perched the stuffed body of an owl; the kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´. The
second post, of similar size, is painted red, and over the entire
surface of it are spots of white made by applying clay with the finger
tips. (<a href="#plateXV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XV</span></a>, No.&nbsp;2.) These spots are symbolical of
the sacred mī´gis, the great number of them denoting increased power of
the magic influence which fills the Midē´wigân. A small cedar tree is
also planted at each of the outer angles of the inclosure.</p>

<span class="smallcaps">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Midē´wigân of

<p>The sweat-lodge, as before, is erected at some distance east of the
main entrance of the Midē´wigân, but a larger structure is arranged upon
a similar plan; more ample accommodations must be provided to permit a
larger gathering of Midē´ priests during the period of preparation and
instruction of the candidate.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="second_prep" id="second_prep">
PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>A Midē´ of the first degree is aware of the course to be pursued by
him when he contemplates advancement into the next higher grade. Before
making known to the other members his determination, he is compelled to
procure, either by purchase or otherwise, such a quantity of blankets,
robes, peltries, and other articles of apparel or ornament as will
amount in value to twice the sum at which were estimated the gifts
presented at his first initiation. A year or more usually elapses before
this can be accomplished, as but one hunting season intervenes before
the next annual meeting of the society, when furs are in their prime;
and fruits and maple sugar can be gathered but once during the season,
and these may be converted into money with which to purchase presents
not always found
<span class="pagenum">225</span>
<a name="page225" id="page225"> </a>
<!--png 291-->
at the Indian traders’ stores. Friends may be called upon to advance
goods to effect the accomplishment of his desire, but such loans must be
returned in kind later on, unless otherwise agreed. When a candidate
feels convinced that he has gathered sufficient material to pay for his
advancement, he announces to those members of the society who are of a
higher grade than the first degree that he wishes to present himself at
the proper time for initiation. This communication is made to eight of
the highest or officiating priests, in his own wig´iwam, to which they
have been specially invited. A feast is prepared and partaken of, after
which he presents to each some tobacco, and smoking is indulged in for
the purpose of making proper offerings, as already described. The
candidate then informs his auditors of his desire and enumerates the
various goods and presents which he has procured to offer at the proper
time. The Midē´ priests sit in silence and meditate; but as they have
already been informally aware of the applicant’s wish, they are prepared
as to the answer they will give, and are governed according to the
estimated value of the gifts. Should the decision of the Midē´ priests
be favorable, the candidate procures the services of one of those
present to assume the office of instructor or preceptor, to whom, as
well as to the officiating priests, he displays his ability in his
adopted specialties in medical magic, etc. He seeks, furthermore, to
acquire additional information upon the preparation of certain secret
remedies, and to this end he selects a preceptor who has the reputation
of possessing&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>For acting in the capacity of instructor, a Midē´ priest receives
blankets, horses, and whatever may be mutually agreed upon between
himself and his pupil. The meetings take place at the instructor’s
wig´iwam at intervals of a week or two; and sometimes during the autumn
months, preceding the summer in which the initiation is to be conferred,
the candidate is compelled to resort to a sudatory and take a vapor
bath, as a means of purgation preparatory to his serious consideration
of the sacred rites and teachings with which his mind “and heart” must
henceforth be occupied, to the exclusion of everything that might tend
to divert his thoughts.</p>

<p>What the special peculiarities and ceremonials of initiation into the
second degree may have been in former times, it is impossible to
ascertain at this late day. The only special claims for benefits to be
derived through this advancement, as well as into the third and fourth
degrees, are, that a Midē´ upon his admission into a new degree receives
the protection of that Man´idō alleged and believed to be the special
guardian of such degree, and that the repetition of initiation adds to
the magic powers previously received by the initiate. In the first
degree the sacred mīgis was “shot” into the two sides, the heart, and
head of the candidate, whereas in the second degree this sacred, or
magic, influence, is directed by the priests
<span class="pagenum">226</span>
<a name="page226" id="page226"> </a>
<!--png 292-->
toward the candidate’s joints, in accordance with a belief entertained
by some priests and referred to in connection with the Red Lake chart
presented on <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span></a>. The second, third, and fourth degrees are
practically mere repetitions of the first, and the slight differences
between them are noted under their respective captions.</p>

<p>In addition to a recapitulation of the secrets pertaining to the
therapeutics of the Midē´, a few additional magic remedies are taught
the candidate in his preparatory instruction. The chief of these are
described below.</p>

<p class="hanging">
Ma-kwa´ wī´-i-sŏp, “Bear’s Gall,” and Pi´-zhi-ki wī´-i-sŏp, “Ox Gall,”
are both taken from the freshly killed animal and hung up to dry. It is
powdered as required, and a small pinch of it is dissolved in water, a
few drops of which are dropped into the ear of a patient suffering from
earache.</p>

<p class="hanging">
Gō´-gi-mish (gen. et sp.?).&mdash;A plant, described by the preceptor as
being about 2 feet in height, having black bark and clusters of small
red flowers.</p>

<p class="hanging two">
1. The bark is scraped from the stalk, crushed and dried. When it is to
be used the powder is put into a small bag of cloth and soaked in hot
water to extract the virtue. It is used to expel evil man´idōs which
cause obstinate coughs, and is also administered to consumptives. The
quantity of bark derived from eight stems, each 10 inches long, makes a
large dose. When a Midē´ gives this medicine to a patient, he fills his
pipe and smokes, and before the tobacco is all consumed the patient
vomits.</p>

<p class="hanging two">
2. The root of this plant mixed with the following is used to produce
paralysis of the mouth. In consequence of the power it possesses it is
believed to be under the special protection of the Midē´ Man´idō, i.e.,
Ki´tshi Man´idō.</p>

<p class="hanging two">
The compound is employed also to counteract the evil intentions,
conjurations, or other charms of so-called bad Midē´, Wâbĕnō´, and
Jĕs´sakkīd´.</p>

<p class="hanging">
Tzhi-bē´-gŏp&mdash;“Ghost Leaf.”</p>

<p class="hanging two">
After the cuticle is removed from the roots the thick under-bark is
crushed into a powder. It is mixed with Gō´gimish.</p>

<p class="hanging">

<p>It is impossible to state the nature of the plants mentioned in the
above compound, as they are not indigenous to the vicinity of White
Earth, Minnesota, but are procured from Indians living in the eastern
extremity of the State and in Wisconsin. Poisonous plants are of rare
occurrence in this latitude, and if any actual poisonous properties
exist in the mixture they may be introduced by the Indian himself, as
strychnia is frequently to be purchased at almost any of the stores, to
be used in the extermination of noxious animals. Admitting that crotalus
venom may be present, the introduction into the human circulation of
this substance would without doubt produce death and not paralysis of
the facial muscles, and if taken into the stomach it quickly undergoes
chemical change when brought in contact with the gastric juice, as is
well known
<span class="pagenum">227</span>
<a name="page227" id="page227"> </a>

from experiments made by several well known physiologists, and
particularly by Dr. Coxe (Dispensatory, 1839), who employed the contents
of the venom sack, mixed with bread, for the cure of rheumatism.</p>

<p>I mention this because of my personal knowledge of six cases at White
Earth, in which paralysis of one side of the face occurred soon after
the Midē´ administered this compound. In nearly all of them the
distortion disappeared after a lapse of from six weeks to three months,
though one is known to have continued for several years with no signs of
recovery. The Catholic missionary at White Earth, with whom conversation
was held upon this subject, feels impressed that some of the so-called
“bad Midē´” have a knowledge of some substance, possibly procured from
the whites, which they attempt to employ in the destruction of enemies,
rivals, or others. It may be possible that the instances above referred
to were cases in which the dose was not sufficient to kill the victim,
but was enough to disable him temporarily. Strychnia is the only
substance attainable by them that could produce such symptoms, and then
only when given in an exceedingly small dose. It is also alleged by
almost every one acquainted with the Ojibwa that they do possess
poisons, and that they employ them when occasion demands in the removal
of personal enemies or the enemies of those who amply reward the Midē´
for such service.</p>

<p>When the time of ceremony of initiation approaches, the chief Midē´
priest sends out a courier to deliver to each member an invitation to
attend (<a href="#plateXII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">XII</span></a>), while the candidate removes his wig´iwam
to the vicinity of the place where the Midē´wigân has been erected. On
the fifth day before the celebration he visits the sweat-lodge, where he
takes his first vapor bath, followed on the next by another; on the
following day he takes the third bath, after which his preceptor visits
him. After making an offering to Ki´tshi Man´iō the priest sings a song,
of which the characters are reproduced in <a href="#plateXIIIa">Pl.
<span class="smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;A</a>. The Ojibwa words
employed in singing are given in the first lines, and are said to be the
ancient phraseology as taught for many generations. They are archaic, to
a great extent, and have additional meaningless syllables inserted, and
used as suffixes which are intoned to prolong notes. The second line of
the Ojibwa text consists of the words as they are spoken at the present
time, to each of which is added the interpretation. The radical
similarity between the two is readily perceived.</p>

<p>The singer accompanies his song either by using a short baton of
wood, termed “singing stick” or the Midē´ drum. After the song is
completed another present of tobacco is given to the preceptor, and
after making an offering of smoke both persons return to their
respective wig´iwams. Later in the evening the preceptor calls upon the
candidate, when both, with the assistance of friends, carry the presents
to the Midē´wigân, where they are suspended from the rafters,
<span class="pagenum">231</span>
<a name="page231" id="page231"> </a>
<!--png 301-->
to be ready for distribution after the initiation on the following day.
Several friends of the candidate, who are Midē´, are stationed at the
doors of the Midē´wigân to guard against the intrusion of the
uninitiated, or the possible abstraction of the gifts by strangers.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="second_init" id="second_init">
INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>The candidate proceeds early on the morning of the day of initiation
to take possession of the sweat-lodge, where he awaits the coming of his
preceptor and the eight officiating priests. He has an abundance of
tobacco with which to supply all the active participants, so that they
may appease any feeling of opposition of the man´idōs toward the
admission of a new candidate, and to make offerings of tobacco to the
guardian spirit of the second degree of the Midē´wiwin. After the usual
ceremony of smoking individual songs are indulged in by the Midē´
priests until such time as they may deem it necessary to proceed to the
Midē´wigân, where the members of the society have long since gathered
and around which is scattered the usual crowd of spectators. The
candidate leads the procession from the sweat-lodge to the eastern
entrance of the Midē´wigân, carrying an ample supply of tobacco and
followed by the priests who chant. When the head of the procession
arrives at the door of the sacred inclosure a halt is made, the priests
going forward and entering. The drummer, stationed within, begins to
drum and sing, while the preceptor and chief officiating priest continue
their line of march around the inclosure, going by way of the south or
left hand. Eight circuits are made, the last terminating at the main or
eastern entrance. The drumming then ceases and the candidate is taken to
the inner side of the door, when all the members rise and stand in their
places. The officiating priests approach and stand near the middle of
the inclosure, facing the candidate, when one of them says to the Midē´
priest beside the latter: O-da´-pin a-sē´-ma&mdash;“Take it, the
tobacco,” whereupon the Midē´ spoken to relieves the candidate of the
tobacco and carries it to the middle of the inclosure, where it is laid
upon a blanket spread upon the ground. The preceptor then takes from the
cross-poles some of the blankets or robes and gives them to the
candidate to hold. One of the malevolent spirits which oppose the
entrance of a stranger is still supposed to remain with the Midē´wigân,
its body being that of a serpent, like flames of fire, reaching from the
earth to the sky. He is called I´-shi-ga-nē´-bĭ-gŏg&mdash;“Big-Snake.”
To appease his anger the candidate must make a present; so the preceptor
says for the candidate:</p>

<table class="parallel" summary="line-by-line translation">
<tr class="ojibwa">
<td>Ka-wī´<sup>n</sup>-nĭ-na-ga´</td>
<td>wa´-ba-ma´-si-ba´-shĭ-gi´-ne-gēt´?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="gloss">
<td>Do you not see</td>
<td>how he carries the goods?</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This being assented to by the Midē´ priests the preceptor takes the
blankets and deposits them near the tobacco upon the ground. Slight taps
upon the Midē´ drum are heard and the candidate is led
<span class="pagenum">232</span>
<a name="page232" id="page232"> </a>
<!--png 302-->
toward the left on his march round the interior of the Midē´wigân, the
officiating priests following and being followed in succession by all
others present. The march continues until the eighth passage round, when
the members begin to step back into their respective places, while the
officiating Midē´ finally station themselves with their backs toward the
westernmost degree post, and face the door at the end of the structure.
The candidate continues round to the western end, faces the Midē´
priests, and all sit down. The following song is then sung, which may be
the individual production of the candidate (<a href="#plateXIIIc">Pl.
<span class="smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;C</a>). A song is part of
the ritual, though it is not necessary that the candidate should sing
it, as the preceptor may do so for him. In the instance under my
observation the song was an old one (which had been taught the
candidate), as the archaic form of pronunciation indicates. Each of the
lines is repeated as often as the singer may desire, the prolongation of
the song being governed by his inspired condition. The same peculiarity
governs the insertion, between words and at the end of lines, of
apparently meaningless vowel sounds, to reproduce and prolong the last
notes sounded. This may be done ad libitum, rythmical accentuation being
maintained by gently tapping upon the Midē´ drum.</p>

<p>As each of the preceding lines or verses is sung in such a protracted
manner as to appear like a distinct song, the dancers, during the
intervals of rest, always retire to their places and sit down.
<span class="pagenum">234</span>
<a name="page234" id="page234"> </a>

The dancing is not so energetic as many of those commonly indulged in
for amusement only. The steps consist of two treading movements made by
each foot in succession. Keeping time with the drum-beats, at the same
time there is a shuffling movement made by the dancer forward, around
and among his companions, but getting back toward his place before the
verse is ended. The attitude during these movements consists in bending
the body forward, while the knees are bent, giving one the appearance of
searching for a lost object. Those who do not sing give utterance to
short, deep grunts, in accordance with the alternate heavier strokes
upon the drum.</p>

<p>As the dancing ceases, and all are in their proper seats, the
preceptor, acting for the candidate, approaches the pile of tobacco and
distributes a small quantity to each one present, when smoking is
indulged in, preceded by the usual offering to the east, the south, the
west, the north, the sky and the earth.</p>

<p>After the completion of this ceremonial an attendant carries the
Midē´ drum to the southeast angle of the inclosure, where it is
delivered to the drummer; then the officiating priests rise and approach
within two or three paces of the candidate as he gets upon his knees.
The preceptor and the assistant who is called upon by him take their
places immediately behind and to either side of the candidate, and the
Midē´ priest lowest in order of precedence begins to utter quick, deep
tones, resembling the sound hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, at the same time
grasping his midē´ sack with both hands, as if it were a gun, and moving
it in a serpentine and interrupted manner toward one of the large joints
of the candidate’s arms or legs. At the last utterance of this sound he
produces a quick puff with the breath and thrusts the bag forward as if
shooting, which he pretends to do, the missile being supposed to be the
invisible sacred mī´gis. The other priests follow in order from the
lowest to the highest, each selecting a different joint, during which
ordeal the candidate trembles more and more violently until at last he
is overcome with the magic influence and falls forward upon the ground
unconscious. The Midē´ priests then lay their sacks upon his back, when
the candidate begins to recover and spit out the mī´gis shell which he
had previously hidden within his mouth. Then the chief Midē´ takes it up
between the tips of the forefinger and thumb and goes through the
ceremony described in connection with the initiation into the first
degree, of holding it toward the east, south, west, north, and the sky,
and finally to the mouth of the candidate, when the latter, who has
partly recovered from his apparently insensible condition, again
relapses into that state. The eight priests then place their sacks to
the respective joints at which they previously directed them, which
fully infuses the body with the magic influence as desired. Upon this
the candidate recovers, takes up the mī´gis shell and, placing it upon
his left palm, holds it forward and swings it from side to side, saying
he!
<span class="pagenum">235</span>

<!--png 305-->
he! he! he! he! and pretends to swallow it, this time only reeling from
its effects. He is now restored to a new life for the second time; and
as the priests go to seek seats he is left on the southern side and
seats himself. After all those who have been occupied with the
initiation have hung up their midē´ sacks on available projections
against the wall or branches, the new member goes forward to the pile of
tobacco, blankets, and other gifts and divides them among those present,
giving the larger portions to the officiating priests. He then passes
around once more, stopping before each one to pass his hands over the
sides of the priests’ heads, and says:</p>

<p>to which each responds hau´, ē<sup>n</sup>. The word hau´ is a term
of approbation, ē<sup>n</sup> signifying yes, or affirmation, the two
thus used together serving to intensify the expression. Those of the
Midē´ present who are of the second, or even some higher degree, then
indulge in the ceremony of passing around to the eastern part of the
inclosure, where they feign coughing and gagging, so as to produce from
the mouth the mī´gis shell, as already narrated in connection with the
first degree, p. 192.</p>

<p>This manner of thanking the officiating Midē´ for their services in
initiating the candidate into a higher degree is extended also to those
members of the Midē´wiwin who are of the first degree only, in
acknowledgment of the favor of their presence at the ceremony, they
being eligible to attend ceremonial rites of any degree higher than the
class to which they belong, because such men are neither benefited nor
influenced in any way by merely witnessing such initiation, but they
must themselves take the principal part in it to receive the favor of a
renewed life and to become possessed of higher power and increased magic
influence.</p>

<p>Various members of the society indulge in short harangues, recounting
personal exploits in the performance of magic and exorcism, to which the
auditors respond in terms of gratification and exclamations of approval.
During these recitals the ushers, appointed for the purpose, leave the
inclosure by the western door to return in a short time with kettles of
food prepared for the midē´ feast. The ushers make four circuits of the
interior, giving to each person present a quantity of the contents of
the several vessels, so that all receive sufficient to gratify their
desires. When the last of the food has been consumed, or removed, the
midē´ drum is heard, and soon a song is started, in which all who desire
join. After the first two or three verses of the song are recited, a
short interval of
<span class="pagenum">236</span>
<a name="page236" id="page236"> </a>
<!--png 306-->
rest is taken, but when it is resumed dancing begins and is continued to
the end. In this manner they indulge in singing and dancing,
interspersed with short speeches, until the approach of sunset, when the
members retire to their own wig´iwams, leaving the Midē´-wigân by the
western egress.</p>

<p>The ushers, assisted by the chief Midē´, then remove the sacred post
from the inclosure and arrange the interior for new initiations, either
of a lower or higher class, if candidates have prepared and presented
themselves. In case there is no further need of meeting again at once,
the members of the society and visitors return upon the following day to
their respective homes.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="second_desc" id="second_desc">
DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>The mī´gis shell employed in the second degree initiation is of the
same species as those before mentioned. At White Earth, however, some of
the priests claim an additional shell as characteristic of this advanced
degree, and insist that this should be as nearly round as possible,
having a perforation through it by which it may be secured with a strand
or sinew. In the absence of a rounded white shell a bead may be used as
a substitute. On <a href="#plateXI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XI</span></a>, No. 4, is presented an illustration of the
bead (the second-degree <ins class="correction"
title="text reads ‘mì´gis’">mī´gis</ins>) presented to me on the
occasion of my initiation.</p>

<p>With reference to the style of facial decoration resorted to in this
degree nearly all of the members now paint the face according to their
own individual tastes, though a few old men still adhere to the
traditional method previously described (pp. 180, 181). The candidate
usually adopts the style practiced by his preceptor, to which he is
officially entitled; but if the preceptor employed in the preparatory
instruction for the second degree be not the same individual whose
services were retained for the first time, then the candidate has the
privilege of painting his face according to the style of the preceding
degree. If he follow his last preceptor it is regarded as an exceptional
token of respect, and the student is not expected to follow the method
in his further advancement.</p>

<p>A Midē´ of the second degree is also governed by his tutelary daimon;
e.g., if during the first fast and vision he saw a bear, he now prepares
a necklace of bear-claws, which is worn about the neck and crosses the
middle of the breast. He now has the power of changing his form into
that of a bear; and during that term of his disguise he wreaks vengeance
upon his detractors and upon victims for whose destruction he has been
liberally rewarded. Immediately upon the accomplishment of such an act
he resumes his human form and thus escapes identification and detection.
Such persons are termed by many “bad medicine men,” and the practice of
thus debasing the sacred teachings of the Midē´wiwin is discountenanced
by members of the society generally. Such pretensions are firmly
believed in
<span class="pagenum">237</span>
<a name="page237" id="page237"> </a>
<!--png 307-->
and acknowledged by the credulous and are practiced by that class of
Shamans here designated as the Wâbĕnō´.</p>

<p>In his history<a class="tag" name="tag129" id="tag129" href="#note129">129</a> Rev. Mr. Jones says:</p>

<blockquote>As the powwows always unite witchcraft with the application
of their medicines I shall here give a short account of this curious
art.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witches and wizards are persons supposed to possess the
agency of familiar spirits from whom they receive power to inflict
diseases on their enemies, prevent good luck of the hunter and the
success of the warrior. They are believed to fly invisibly at pleasure
from place to place; to turn themselves into bears, wolves, foxes, owls,
bats, and snakes. Such metamorphoses they pretend to accomplish by
putting on the skins of these animals, at the same time crying and
howling in imitation of the creature they wish to represent. Several of
our people have informed me that they have seen and heard witches in the
shape of these animals, especially the bear and the fox. They say that
when a witch in the shape of a bear is being chased all at once she will
run round a tree or a hill, so as to be lost sight of for a time by her
pursuers, and then, instead of seeing a bear they behold an old woman
walking quietly along or digging up roots, and looking as innocent as a
lamb. The fox witches are known by the flame of fire which proceeds out
of their mouths every time they bark.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Many receive the name of witches without making any
pretensions to the art, merely because they are deformed or ill-looking.
Persons esteemed witches or wizards are generally eccentric characters,
remarkably wicked, of a ragged appearance and forbidding countenance.
The way in which they are made is either by direct communication with
the familiar spirit during the days of their fasting, or by being
instructed by those skilled in the art.</blockquote>

<p>A Midē´ of the second degree has the reputation of superior powers on
account of having had the mī´gis placed upon all of his joints, and
especially because his heart is filled with magic power, as is shown in
<a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span></a>, No.
48. In this drawing the disk upon the breast denotes where the mī´gis
has been “shot” into the figure, the enlarged size of the circle
signifying “greater abundance,” in contradistinction to the common
designation of a mī´gis shown only by a simple spot or small point. One
of this class is enabled to hear and see what is transpiring at a remote
distance, the lines from the hands indicating that he is enabled to
grasp objects which are beyond the reach of a common person, and the
lines extending from the feet signifying that he can traverse space and
transport himself to the most distant points. Therefore he is sought
after by hunters for aid in the discovery and capture of game, for
success in war, and for the destruction of enemies, however remote may
be their residence.</p>

<p>When an enemy or a rival is to be dealt with a course is pursued
similar to that followed when preparing hunting charts, though more
powerful magic medicines are used. In the following description of a
pictograph recording such an occurrence the Midē´, or rather the
Wâbĕnō´, was of the fourth degree of the Midē´wiwin. The indication of
the grade of the operator is not a necessary part of the record, but in
this instance appears to have been prompted
<span class="pagenum">238</span>
<a name="page238" id="page238"> </a>
<!--png 308-->
from motives of vanity. The original sketch, of which <a href="#fig24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a> is a reproduction, was drawn upon birch-bark
by a Midē´, in 1884, and the ceremony detailed actually occurred at
White Earth, Minnesota. By a strange coincidence the person against whom
vengeance was aimed died of pneumonia the following spring, the disease
having resulted from cold contracted during the preceding winter. The
victim resided at a camp more than a hundred miles east of the locality
above named, and his death was attributed to the Midē´’s power, a
reputation naturally procuring for him many new adherents and disciples.
The following is the explanation as furnished by a Midē´ familiar with
the circumstances:</p>

<p class="hanging">

<p class="hanging">
No. 9 is the outline of a lake, where the subject operated upon

<p>War parties are not formed at this time, but mnemonic charts of songs
used by priests to encourage war parties, are still extant, and a
reproduction of one is given on <a href="#plateXIIId">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIII</span>,&nbsp;D</a>. This song was used by the Midē´
priest to insure success to the parties. The members who intended
participating in the exhibition would meet on the evening preceding
their departure, and while listening to the words, some would join in
the singing while others would dance. The lines may be repeated ad
libitum so as to lengthen the entire series of phrases according to the
prevalent enthusiasm and the time at the disposal of the performers. The
war drum was used, and there were always five or six drummers so as to
produce sufficient noise to accord with the loud and animated singing of
a large body of excited men. This drum is, in size, like that employed
for dancing. It is made by covering with rawhide an old kettle, or
wooden vessel, from 2 to 3 feet in diameter. The drum is then attached
to four sticks, or short posts, so as to prevent its touching the
ground, thus affording every advantage for producing full and resonant
sounds, when struck. The drumsticks are strong withes, at the end of
each of which is fastened a ball of buckskin thongs. The following lines
are repeated ad libitum:</p>

the third degree.</p>

<p>The structure in which the third degree of the Midē´wiwin is
conferred resembles that of the two preceding, and an outline is
presented in <a href="#fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>. In this degree three
posts are erected, the first one resembling that of the first degree,
being painted red with a band of green around the top. (<a href="#plateXV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XV</span></a>, No.&nbsp;1.)
This is planted a short distance to the east of the middle of the floor.
The second post is also painted red, but has scattered over its entire
surface spots of white clay, each of about the size of a silver quarter
of a dollar, symbolical of the mī´gis shell. Upon the top of this post
is placed the stuffed body of an owl&mdash;Kŏ-kó-kŏ-ō´. (<a href="#plateXV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XV</span></a>, No.&nbsp;2.)
This post is planted a short distance west of the first one and about
midway between it and the third, which last is erected within about 6 or
8 feet from the western door, and is painted black. (<a href="#plateXV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XV</span></a>, No.&nbsp;3.)
The sacred stone against which patients are placed, and which has the
alleged virtue of removing or expelling the demons that cause disease,
is placed upon the ground at the usual spot near the eastern entrance
(<a href="#fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>, No.&nbsp;1). The Makwá
Man´idō&mdash;bear spirit&mdash;is the tutelary guardian of this degree.
Cedar trees are planted at each of the outer angles of the structure (<a
href="#fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>, Nos. 6, 7, 8,&nbsp;9). The sudatory is
erected about 100 yards due east of the main entrance of the Midē´wigân,
and is of the same size and for the same purpose as that for the second
degree.</p>

PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>It is customary for the period of one year to elapse before a
second-degree Midē´ can be promoted, even if he be provided with enough
presents for such advancement. As the exacted fee consists of goods and
tobacco thrice the value of the fee for the first degree, few present
themselves. This degree is not held in as high estimation, relatively,
as the preceding one; but it is alleged that a Midē´’s powers are
intensified by again subjecting himself to the ceremony of being “shot
with the sacred mī´gis,” and he is also elevated to that rank by means
of which he may be enabled the better to invoke the assistance of the
tutelary guardian of this degree.</p>

<p>A Midē´ who has in all respects complied with the preliminaries of
announcing to the chief Midē´ his purpose, gaining satisfactory evidence
of his resources and ability to present the necessary presents, and of
his proficiency in the practice of medical magic, etc., selects a
preceptor of at least the third degree and one who is held in high
repute and influence in the Midē´wiwin. After procuring the services of
such a person and making a satisfactory agreement with him, he may be
enabled to purchase from him some special formulæ for which he is
distinguished. The instruction embraces a résumé of the traditions
previously given, the various uses and properties of magic plants and
compounds with which the preceptor is familiar, and conversations
relative to exploits performed in medication, incantation, and exorcism.
Sometimes the candidate is enabled to acquire new “medicines” to add to
his list, and the following is a translation of the tradition relating
to the origin of ginseng (Aralia quinquefolia, Gr.), the so-called “man
root,” held in high estimation as of divine origin. In <a href="#fig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a> is presented a pictorial representation of the
story, made by Ojibwa, a Midē´ priest of White Earth, Minnesota. The
tradition purports to be an account of a visit of the spirit of a boy to
the abode of Dzhibai´Man´idō, “the chief spirit of the place of souls,”
called Ne´-ba-gi´-zis, “the land of the sleeping sun.”</p>

Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Origin of Ginseng.</p>

<p class="link"><a href="images/figures/fig3.png" target="_blank">Larger Figure</a></p>

<p>There appears to be some similarity between this tradition and that
given in connection with <a href="#plateV">Pl. <span class="smallroman">V</span></a>, in which the Sun Spirit restored to life a
boy, by which act he exemplified a portion of the ritual of the
Midē´wiwin. It is probable therefore that the following tradition is a
corruption of the former and made to account for the origin of “man
root,” as ginseng is designated, this root, or certain portions of it,
being so extensively employed in various painful complaints.</p>

<blockquote>Once an old Midē´, with his wife and son, started out on a
hunting trip, and, as the autumn was changing into winter, the three
erected a substantial wig´iwam. The snow began to fall and the cold
increased, so they decided to remain and eat of their stores, game
having been abundant and a good supply having been procured.
<span class="pagenum">242</span>
<a name="page242" id="page242"> </a>
<!--png 316-->
The son died; whereupon his mother immediately set out for the village
to obtain help to restore him to life, as she believed her father, the
chief priest of the Midē´-wiwin, able to accomplish this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the woman informed her father of the death of her son,
her brother, who was present, immediately set out in advance to render
assistance. The chief priest then summoned three assistant Midē´, and
they accompanied his daughter to the place where the body of his dead
grandson lay upon the floor of the wig´iwam, covered with
robes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The chief Midē´ placed himself at the left shoulder of the
dead boy, the next in rank at the right, while the two other assistants
stationed themselves at the feet. Then the youngest Midē´&mdash;he at
the right foot of the deceased&mdash;began to chant a midē´ song, which
he repeated a second, a third, and a fourth time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When he had finished, the Midē´ at the left foot sang a
midē´ song four times; then the Midē´ at the right shoulder of the body
did the same, after which the chief Midē´ priest sang his song four
times, whereupon there was a perceptible movement under the blanket, and
as the limbs began to move the blanket was taken off, when the boy sat
up. Being unable to speak, he made signs that he desired water, which
was given to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The four Midē´ priests then chanted medicine songs, each
preparing charmed remedies which were given to the boy to complete his
recovery. The youngest Midē´, standing at the foot of the patient, gave
him four pinches of powder, which he was made to swallow; the Midē´ at
the left foot did the same; then the Midē´ at the right shoulder did
likewise, and he, in turn, was followed by the chief priest standing at
the left shoulder of the boy; whereupon the convalescent immediately
recovered his speech and said that during the time that his body had
been in a trance his spirit had been in the “spirit land,” and had
learned of the “grand medicine.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The boy then narrated what his spirit had experienced during
the trance, as follows: “Gi´-gi-min´-ĕ-go´-min mi-dē´-wi-wĭn mi-dē´
man´-i-dō´ <a class="tag" name="tagB" id="tagB" href="#noteB">B</a>’n-gi-gĭn´-o-a-mâk ban-dzhi´-ge´-o-we´-ân

<p>The following is a translation:</p>

<blockquote><ins class="correction" title="open quote missing">“</ins>He,
the chief spirit of the Midē´ Society, gave us the
“grand medicine,” and he has taught us how to use it. I have come back
from the spirit land. There will be twelve, all of whom will take wives;
when the last of these is no longer without a wife, then will I die.
That is the time. The Midē´ spirit taught us to do right. He gave us
life and told us how to prolong it. These things he taught us, and gave
us roots for medicine. I give to you medicine; if your head is sick,
this medicine put upon it, you will put it on.”</blockquote>

<p>The revelation received by the boy was in the above manner imparted
to the Indians. The reference to twelve&mdash;three times the sacred
number four&mdash;signifies that twelve chief priests shall succeed each
other before death will come to the narrator. It is observed, also, that
a number of the words are archaic, which fact appears to be an
indication of some antiquity, at least, of the tradition.</p>

<p>The following are the principal forms in which a Midē´ will utilize
Aralia quinquefolia, Gr., ginseng&mdash;Shtĕ´-na-bi-o´-dzhi-bik:</p>

<span class="pagenum">243</span>

<p class="hanging">
1. Small quantities of powdered root are swallowed to relieve stomachic
pains.</p>

<p class="hanging">
2. A person complaining with acute pains in any specific part of the
body is given that part of the root corresponding to the part affected;
e.g., for pleurisy, the side of the root is cut out, and an infusion
given to relieve such pains; if one has pains in the lower extremities,
the bifurcations of the root are employed; should the pains be in the
thorax, the upper part of the root&mdash;corresponding to the
chest&mdash;is used in a similar manner.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="third_init" id="third_init">
INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>As the candidate for promotion has acquired from his Midē´ friends
such new information as they choose to impart, and from his instructor
all that was practicable, he has only to await the day of ceremony to be
publicly acknowledged as a third-degree Midē´. As this time approaches
the invitation sticks are sent to the various members and to such
non-resident Midē´ as the officiating priests may wish to honor. On or
before the fifth day previous to the meeting the candidate moves to the
vicinity of the Midē´wigân. On that day the first sweat bath is taken,
and one also upon each succeeding day until four baths, as a ceremony of
purification, have been indulged in. On the evening of the day before
the meeting his preceptor visits him at his own wig´iwam when, with the
assistance of friends, the presents are collected and carried to the
Midē´-wigân and suspended from the transverse poles near the roof. The
officiating priests may subsequently join him, when smoking and singing
form the chief entertainment of the evening.</p>

<p>By this time numerous visitors have gathered together and are
encamped throughout the adjacent timber, and the sound of the drum,
where dancing is going on, may be heard far into the night.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the day of the ceremonies the candidate goes
to the sudatory where he first awaits the coming of his preceptor and
later the arrival of the Midē´ priests by whom he is escorted to the
Midē´wigân. With the assistance of the preceptor he arranges his gift of
tobacco which he takes with him to the sacred inclosure, after which a
smoke offering is made, and later Midē´ songs are chanted. These may be
of his own composition as he has been a professor of magic a sufficient
lapse of time to have composed them, but to give evidence of superior
powers the chief, or some other of the officiating priests, will perhaps
be sufficiently inspired to sing. The following was prepared and chanted
by one of the Midē´ priests at the third-degree meeting at White Earth,
Minnesota, and the illustration in <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘Pl. XVII, A’">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIV</span>,&nbsp;A</ins>, is a reproduction of the

form, and are presented as they were chanted. The several lines may be
repeated ad libitum to accord with the feeling of inspiration which the
singer experiences, or the amount of interest manifested by his

<p>All the members of the society not officially inducting the candidate

sticks near the sacred stone, or, in the event of their inability

to attend, have sent them with an explanation. The candidate, at the
suggestion of the Midē´ priest, then prepares to leave the sudatory,
gathers up the tobacco, and as he slowly advances toward the Midē´
inclosure his attendants fall into the procession according to their
office. The priests sing as they go forward, until they reach the
entrance of the Midē´wigân, where the candidate and his preceptor halt,
while the remainder enter and take their stations just within the door,
facing the west.</p>

<p>The drummers, who are seated in the southwestern angle of the
inclosure, begin to drum and sing, while the candidate is led slowly
around the exterior, going by the south, thus following the course of
the sun. Upon the completion of the fourth circuit he is halted directly
opposite the main entrance, to which his attention is then directed. The
drumming and singing cease; the candidate beholds two Midē´ near the
outer entrance and either side of it. These Midē´ represent two
malevolent man´idō and guard the door against the entrance of those not
duly prepared. The one upon the northern side of the entrance then
addresses his companion in the following words: I´-ku-tan ka´-wi-nad´-gĭ
wa´-na-mâ´-sĭ ē´-zhĭ-gĭ´-nĭ-gĕd&mdash;“Do you not see how he is formed?”
To which the other responds: O-da´-pĭ-nŏ´ ke´-no-wĭn-dŭng
shkwan´-dĭm&mdash;“Take care of it, the door;” [i.e., guard the
entrance.] The former then again speaks to his companion, and says:
Ka-wīn´-nĭ-na-ga´ wâ´-ba-ma´-si-ba´-shĭ-gi´-ne-gēt´&mdash;“Do you not
see how he carries the goods?” The Midē´ spoken to assents to this, when
the preceptor takes several pieces of tobacco which he presents to the
two guards, whereupon they permit the candidate to advance to the inner
entrance, where he is again stopped by two other guardian man´idō, who
turn upon him as if to inquire the reason of his intrusion. The
candidate then holds out two parcels of tobacco and says to them:
O-da´-pin a-sē´-ma&mdash;“Take it, the tobacco,” whereupon they receive
the gift and stand aside, saying: Kun´-da-dan&mdash;“Go down;” [i.e.,
enter and follow the path.] As the candidate is taken a few steps
forward and toward the sacred stone, four of the eight officiating
priests receive him, one replacing the preceptor who goes to the extreme
western end there to stand and face the east, where another joins him,
while the remaining two place themselves side by side so as to face the
west.</p>

<p>It is believed that there are five powerful man´idōs who abide within
the third-degree Midē´wigân, one of whom is the Midē´
man´idō&mdash;Ki´tshi Man´idō&mdash;one being present at the sacred
stone, the second at that part of the ground between the sacred stone
and the first part where the gifts are deposited, the remaining three at
the three degree posts.</p>

<p>As the candidate starts and continues upon his walk around the
interior of the inclosure the musicians begin to sing and drum, while
all those remaining are led toward the left, and when opposite the
<span class="pagenum">246</span>

sacred stone he faces it and is turned round so that his back is not
toward it in passing; the same is done at the second place where one of
the spirits is supposed to abide; again at first, second, and third
posts. By this time the candidate is at the western extremity of the
structure, and as the second Midē´ receives him in charge, the other
taking his station beside the preceptor, he continues his course toward
the north and east to the point of departure, going through similar
evolutions as before, as he passes the three posts, the place of gifts
and the sacred stone. This is done as an act of reverence to the
man´idōs and to acknowledge his gratitude for their presence and
encouragement. When he again arrives at the eastern extremity of the
inclosure he is placed between the two officiating Midē´, who have been
awaiting his return, while his companion goes farther back, even to the
door, from which point he addresses the other officiating Midē´ as
follows:</p>

<p>Then one of the Midē´ priests standing beside the candidate leads him
to the spot between the sacred stone and the first-degree post where the
blankets and other goods have been deposited, and here he is seated.
This priest then walks slowly around him singing in a tremulous manner
wa´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, hĕ´, returning to a position so as to
face him, when he addresses him as follows: Mĭs-sa´-a-shi´-gwa

<p>The following is a free translation:</p>

<blockquote>The time has arrived for you to ask of the Great Spirit this
“reverence” i.e., the sanctity of this degree. I am interceding in your
behalf, but you think my powers are feeble; I am asking him to confer
upon you the sacred powers. He may cause many to die, but I shall
henceforth watch your course of success in life, and learn if he will
heed your prayers and recognize your magic power.</blockquote>

<p>At the conclusion of these remarks three others of the officiating
Midē´ advance and seat themselves, with their chief, before the
candidate. The Midē´ drum is handed to the chief priest, and after a
short prelude of drumming he becomes more and more inspired, and sings
the following Midē´ song, represented pictorially, also on <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘Pl. XVII, B’"><a href="#plateXIVb">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIV</span>,&nbsp;B</a>.</ins></p>

<p>This song is sung ad libitum according to the inspired condition of
the person singing it. Many of the words are archaic, and differ from
the modern forms.</p>

<p>Then the officiating priests arise and the one lowest in rank grasps
his Midē´ sack and goes through the gestures, described in connection
with the previous degrees, of shooting into the joints and forehead of
the candidate the sacred mī´gis. At the attempt made by the chief priest
the candidate falls forward apparently unconscious. The priests then
touch his joints and forehead with the upper end of their Midē´ sacks
whereupon he recovers and rises to a standing posture. The chief then
addresses him and enjoins him to conduct himself with propriety and in
accordance with the dignity of his profession. The following is the
text, viz: Gi-gan´-bis-sĭn dau´-gē-in´-ni-nân´ kish-bin´-bish-in
dau´-o-ân-nĭn da´-ki-ka-wa´-bi-kwe ga´-kĭ-ne ke-ke´-wi-bi´-na-mōn

<p>The translation is as follows: “You heed to what I say to you; if you
are listening and will do what is right you will live to have white
hair. That is all; you will do away with all bad actions.”</p>

<p>The Midē´ priest second in rank then says to the candidate:
Ke´-go-wi´-ka-za´-gi-to-wa´-kin ki-da´-no-ka´tshĭ-gân kai-ē´-gi-gīt´
a-sē´-ma, kai´-e-mī´-dzĭm, which signifies: “Never begrudge your goods,
neither your tobacco, nor your provisions.” To this the candidate
responds ē<sup>n</sup>´&mdash;yes, by this signifying that he will never
regret what he has given the Midē´ for their services. The candidate
remains standing while the members of the society take seats, after
which he goes to the pile of blankets, skins, and other presents, and
upon selecting appropriate ones for the officiating priests he carries
them to those persons, after which he makes presents of less value to
all other Midē´ present. Tobacco is then distributed, and while all are
preparing to make an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō of tobacco, the

<p>then, stepping back, he clasps his hands and bows toward the Midē´,
adding: Ni-ka´-ni, ni-ka´-ni, ni-ka´-ni, ka-na´,&mdash;“My Midē´ friend,
my Midē´ friend, my Midē´ friend, friend.” To this the Midē´ responds in
affirmation, hau´, ē<sup>n</sup>´&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>The new member then finds a seat on the southern side of the
inclosure, whereupon the ushers&mdash;Midē´ appointed to attend to
outside duties&mdash;retire and bring in the vessels of food which are
carried around to various persons present, four distinct times.</p>

<p>The feast continues for a considerable length of time, after which
the kettles and dishes are again carried outside the Midē´wi-gân, when
all who desire indulge in smoking. Midē´ songs are chanted by one of the
priests, the accompanying, reproduced pictorially in Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIV</span>&nbsp;C, being an example. The lines, as usual,
are repeated ad libitum, the music being limited to but few notes, and

leave the Midē´wigân by the western door, and before night all movable
accessories are taken away from the structure.</p>

<p>The remainder of the evening is spent in visiting friends, dancing,
etc., and upon the following day they all return to their respective
homes.</p>

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>Although the mī´gis shell of the several degrees is generally of the
same species, some of the older Midē´ priests claim that there were
formerly specific shells, each being characteristic and pertaining
specially to each individual grade. The objects claimed by Sika´s-sigĕ
as referring to the third degree are, in addition to the Cypræa monata,
L., a piece of purple wampum, and one shell of elongated form, both
shown on <a href="#plateXI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XI</span></a>, Nos. 3 and 5, respectively.</p>

<p>The fact of a Midē´ having been subjected to “mī´gis shooting” for
the third time is an all-sufficient reason to the Indian why his powers
are in a corresponding manner augmented. His powers of exorcism and
incantation are greater; his knowledge and use of magic medicines more
extended and certain of effect; and his ability to do harm, as in the
capacity of a Wâbĕnō´, is more and more lauded and feared. He becomes
possessed of a greater power in prophecy and prevision, and in this
state enters the class of personages known as the Jĕs´sakkīd´, or
jugglers. His power over darkness and obscurity is indicated on <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, No.
77, upon which the head, chest, and arms are represented as being
covered with lines to designate obscurity, the extended arms with
outstretched hands denoting ability to grasp and control that which is
hidden to the eye.</p>

<p>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ and his manner of performing have already been
mentioned. This class of sorcerers were met with by the Jesuit Fathers
early in the seventeenth century, and referred to under various
designations, such as jongleur, magicien, consulteur du manitou, etc.
Their influence in the tribe was recognized, and formed one of the
greatest obstacles encountered in the Christianization of the Indians.
Although the Jĕs´sakkīd´ may be a seer and prophet as well as a
practitioner of exorcism without becoming a
<span class="pagenum">252</span>
<a name="page252" id="page252"> </a>
<!--png 328-->
member of the Midē´wiwin, it is only when a Midē´ attains the rank of
the third degree that he begins to give evidence of, or pretends to
exhibit with any degree of confidence, the powers accredited to the
former. The structure erected and occupied by the Jĕs´sakkīd´ for the
performance of his powers as prophet or oracle has before been described
as cylindrical, being made by planting four or more poles and wrapping
about them sheets of birch bark, blankets, or similar material that will
serve as a covering. This form of structure is generally represented in
pictographic records, as shown in <a href="#fig26">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustrations, Figs. 27, 28, and 29, reproduced from
birch-bark etchings, were the property of Jĕs´sakkīd´, who were also
Midē´ of the third and fourth degrees. It will be noticed that the
structure used by them is in the form of the ordinary wig´iwam, as their
profession of medical magic is apparently held in higher esteem than the
art of prophecy; their status and claims as Jĕs´sakkīd´ being indicated
by the great number of ma´nidōs which they have the power of invoking.
These man´idōs, or spirits, are indicated by the outline of their
material forms, the heart being indicated and connected with the
interior of the structure to show the power of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ over the
life of the respective spirits. The Thunder-bird usually occupies the
highest position in his estimation, and for this reason is drawn
directly over the wig´iwam. The Turtle is claimed to be the man´idō who
acts as intermediary between the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and the other man´idōs, and
is therefore not found among the characters on the outside of the
wig´iwam, but his presence is indicated within, either at the spot
marking the convergence of the “life lines,” or immediately below it.

etching made by a Jĕs´sakkīd´ at White Earth, Minnesota. The two curved
lines above the Jĕs´sakkan´ represent the sky, from which magic power is
derived, as shown by the waving line extending downward. The small spots
within the structure are “magic spots,” i.e., the presence of man´idōs.
The juggler is shown upon the left side near the base. When a prophet is
so fortunate as to be able to claim one of these man´idōs as his own
tutelary daimon, his advantage in invoking the others is comparatively
greater. Before proceeding to the Jĕs´sakkân´&mdash;or the “Jugglery,”
as the Jĕs´sakkīd´ wig´iwam is commonly designated, a prophet will
prepare himself by smoking and making an offering to his man´idō, and by
singing a chant, of which an example is presented on <a href="#plateXIVd">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIV</span>,&nbsp;D</a>. It
is a reproduction of one made by a Jĕs´sakkīd´ who was also a Midē´ of
the third degree. Each line is chanted as often as may be desired, or
according to the effect which it may be desirable to produce or the
inspired state of the singer.</p>

<p>In addition to the practice of medical magic, the Jĕs´sakkīd´
sometimes resorts to a curious process to extract from the patient’s
body the malevolent beings or man´idōs which cause disease. The method
of procedure is as follows: The Jĕs´sakkīd´ is provided with four or
more tubular bones, consisting of the leg bones of large birds, each of
the thickness of a finger and 4 or 5 inches in length. After the priest
has fasted and chanted prayers for success, he gets down upon all fours
close to the patient and with his mouth near the affected part. After
using the rattle and singing most vociferously to cause the evil man´idō
to take shelter at some particular spot, so that it may be detected and
located by him, he suddenly touches that place with the end of one of
the bones and immediately thereafter putting the other end into his
mouth, as if it were a cigar, strikes it with the flat hand and sends it
apparently down his throat. Then the second bone is treated in the same
manner, as also the third and fourth, the last one being permitted to
protrude from the mouth, when the end is put against the affected part
and sucking is indulged in amid the most violent writhings and
contortions in his endeavors to extract the man´idō. As this object is
supposed to have been reached and swallowed by the Jĕs´sakkīd´ he crawls
away to a short distance from the patient and relieves himself of the
demon with violent
<span class="pagenum">255</span>
<a name="page255" id="page255"> </a>
<!--png 331-->
retchings and apparent suffering. He recovers in a short time, spits out
the bones, and, after directing his patient what further medicine to
swallow, receives his fee and departs. Further description of this
practice will be referred to below and illustrated on <a href="#plateXVIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVIII</span></a>.</p>

<p>The above manner of disposing of the hollow bones is a clever trick
and not readily detected, and it is only by such acts of jugglery and
other delusions that he maintains his influence and importance among the
credulous.</p>

supposed to be points where the Bear Man´idō rested during the struggle
he passed through while fighting with the malevolent man´idōs within to
gain entrance and receive the fourth-degree initiation. Immediately
within and to either side of the east and west entrances is planted a
short post, 5 feet high and 8 inches thick, painted red upon the side
facing the interior and black upon the reverse, at the base of each
being laid a stone about as large as a human head. These four posts

PREPARATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances it requires at least one year before a
Midē´ of the third grade is considered eligible for promotion, and it is
seldom that a candidate can procure the necessary presents within that
period, so that frequently a number of years elapse before any
intimation by a candidate is made to the chief priest that the necessary
requirements can be complied with. The chief reason of this delay is
attributed to the fact that the fee to the officiating priests alone
must equal in value and quantity four times the amount paid at the first
initiation, and as the success in gathering the robes, skins, blankets,
etc., depends upon the candidate’s own exertions it will readily appear
why so few ever attain the distinction sought. Should one be so
fortunate, however, as to possess the required articles, he has only to
make known the fact to the chief and assistant Midē´ priests, when a
meeting is held at the wig´iwam of one of the members and the merits of
the candidate discussed. For this purpose tobacco is furnished by the
candidate. The more valuable and more numerous the presents the more
rapidly will his application be disposed of, and the more certainly will
favorable consideration on it be had. It becomes necessary, as in former
instances of preparation, for the candidate to procure the service of a
renowned Midē´, in order to acquire new or specially celebrated remedies
or charms. The candidate may also give evidence of his own proficiency
in magic without revealing the secrets of his success or the course
pursued to attain it. The greater the mystery the higher he is held in
esteem even by his jealous confrères.</p>

<p>There is not much to be gained by preparatory instruction for the
fourth degree, the chief claims being a renewal of the ceremony of
“shooting the mī´gis” into the body of the candidate, and enacting or
dramatizing the traditional efforts of the Bear Man´idō in his endeavor
to receive from the Otter the secrets of this grade. One who succeeds
becomes correspondingly powerful in his profession and therefore more
feared by the credulous. His sources of income are accordingly increased
by the greater number of Indians who require his assistance. Hunters,
warriors, and lovers have occasion to call upon him, and sometimes
antidoting charms are sought, when the evil effects of an enemy’s work
are to be counteracted.</p>

<p>The instructor receives the visit of the candidate, and upon coming
to a satisfactory agreement concerning the fee to be paid for the
service he prepares his pupil by prompting him as to the part he is to
enact during the initiation and the reasons therefor. The preparation
and the merits of magic compounds are discussed, and
<span class="pagenum">258</span>
<a name="page258" id="page258"> </a>
<!--png 334-->
the pupil receives instruction in making effective charms, compounding
love powder, etc. This love powder is held in high esteem, and its
composition is held a profound secret, to be transmitted only when a
great fee is paid. It consists of the following ingredients: Vermilion;
powdered snakeroot (Polygala senega,&nbsp;L.); exiguam particulam
sanguinis a puella effusi, quum in primis menstruis esset; and a piece
of ginseng cut from the bifurcation of the root, and powdered. These are
mixed and put into a small buckskin bag. The preparation is undertaken
only after an offering to Ki´tshi Man´idō of tobacco and a Midē´ song
with rattle accompaniment. The manner of using this powder will be
described under the caption of “descriptive notes.” It differs entirely
from the powder employed in painting the face by one who wishes to
attract or fascinate the object of his or her devotion. The latter is
referred to by the Rev. Peter Jones<a class="tag" name="tag130" id="tag130" href="#note130">130</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>There is a particular kind of charm which they use when they
wish to obtain the object of their affections. It is made of roots and
red ocher. With this they paint their faces, believing it to possess a
power so irresistible as to cause the object of their desire to love
them. But the moment this medicine is taken away and the charm withdrawn
the person who before was almost frantic with love hates with a perfect
hatred.</blockquote>

<p>It is necessary that the candidate take a sweat-bath once each day,
for four successive days, at some time during the autumn months of the
year preceding the year in which the initiation is to occur. This form
of preparation is deemed agreeable to Ki´tshi Man´idō, whose favor is
constantly invoked that the candidate may be favored with the powers
supposed to be conferred in the last degree. As spring approaches the
candidate makes occasional presents of tobacco to the chief priest and
his assistants, and when the period of the annual ceremony approaches,
they send out runners to members to solicit their presence, and, if of
the fourth degree, their assistance.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="fourth_init" id="fourth_init">
INITIATION OF CANDIDATE.</a></h5>

<p>The candidate removes to the vicinity of the Midē´wigân so as to be
able to go through the ceremony of purgation four times before the day
of initiation. The sudatory having been constructed on the usual site,
east of the large structure, he enters it on the morning of the fifth
day preceding the initiation and after taking a sweat-bath he is joined
by the preceptor, when both proceed to the four entrances of the
Midē´wigân and deposit at each a small offering of tobacco. This
procedure is followed on the second and third days, also, but upon the
fourth the presents are also carried along and deposited at the
entrances, where they are received by assistants and suspended from the
rafters of the interior. On the evening of the last day, the chief and
officiating priests visit the candidate and his preceptor,
<span class="pagenum">259</span>
<a name="page259" id="page259"> </a>
<!--png 335-->
in the sweat-lodge, when ceremonial smoking is indulged in followed by
the recitation of Midē´ chants. The following (<a href="#plateXVIa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;A</a>) is a
reproduction of the chant taught to and recited by the candidate. The
original was obtained from an old mnemonic chart in use at Mille Lacs,
Minnesota, in the year 1825, which in turn had been copied from a record
in the possession of a Midē´ priest at La Pointe, Wisconsin. Many of the

<p>Upon the conclusion of the chant, the assembled Midē´ smoke and
review the manner of procedure for the morrow’s ceremony, and when these
details have been settled they disperse, to return to their wig´iwams,
or to visit Midē´ who may have come from distant settlements.</p>

<p>Early on the day of his initiation the candidate returns to the
sudatory to await the coming of his preceptor. The gifts of tobacco are
divided into parcels which may thus be easily distributed at the proper
time, and as soon as the officiating priests have arrived, and seated
themselves, the candidate produces some tobacco of which all present
take a pipeful, when a ceremonial smoke-offering is made to Ki´tshi
Man´idō. The candidate then takes his midē´ drum and sings a song of his
own composition, or one which he may have purchased from his preceptor,
or some Midē´ priest. The following is a reproduction of an old mnemonic
song which the owner, Sikas´sigĕ, had received from his father who in
turn had obtained it at La Pointe, Wisconsin, about the year 1800. The
words are archaic to a great extent, and they furthermore differ from
the modern language on account of the manner in which they are
pronounced in chanting, which peculiarity has been faithfully followed
below. The pictographic characters are reproduced in <a href="#plateXVIb">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;B</a>. As
usual, the several lines are sung ad libitum, repetition depending
entirely upon the feelings of the singer.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of this preliminary by the candidate, the priests
emerge from the wig´iwam and fall in line according to their official
status, when the candidate and preceptor gather up the parcels of
tobacco and place themselves at the head of the column and start toward
the eastern entrance of the Midē´wigân. As they approach the lone post,
or board, the candidate halts, when the priests continue to chant and
drum upon the Midē´ drum. The chief Midē´ then advances to the board and
peeps through the orifice near the top to view malevolent man´idōs
occupying the interior, who are antagonistic to the entrance of a
stranger. This spot is assumed to represent the resting place or “nest,”
from which the Bear Man´idō viewed the evil spirits during the time of
his initiation by the Otter. The evil spirits within are crouching upon
the floor, one behind the other and facing the east, the first being
Mi-shi´-bi-shi´&mdash;the panther; the second, Me-shi´-kĕ&mdash;the
turtle; the third, kwin´-go-â´-gĭ&mdash;the big wolverine; the fourth,
wâ´-gŭsh&mdash;the fox; the fifth, ma-in´-gŭn&mdash;the wolf; and the
sixth, ma-kwa´&mdash;the bear. They are the ones who endeavor to
counteract or destroy the good wrought by the rites of the Midē´wiwin,
and only by the aid of the good man´idōs can they be driven from the
Midē´wigân so as to permit a candidate to enter and receive the benefits
of the degree. The second Midē´ then views the group of malevolent
beings, after which the third, and lastly the fourth priest looks
through the orifice. They then advise
<span class="pagenum">262</span>
<a name="page262" id="page262"> </a>
<!--png 338-->
the presentation by the candidate of tobacco at that point to invoke the
best efforts of the Midē´ Man´idōs in his behalf.</p>

<p>It is asserted that all of the malevolent man´idōs who occupied and
surrounded the preceding degree structures have now assembled about this
fourth degree of the Midē´wigân to make a final effort against the
admission and advancement of the candidate: therefore he impersonates
the good Bear Man´idō, and is obliged to follow a similar course in
approaching from his present position the entrance of the structure.
Upon hands and knees he slowly crawls toward the main entrance, when a
wailing voice is heard in the east which sounds like the word
hā<sup>n</sup>´, prolonged in a monotone. This is
ge´-gi-si´-bi-ga´-ne-dât man´idō. His bones are heard rattling as he
approaches; he wields his bow and arrow; his long hair streaming in the
air, and his body, covered with mī´gis shells from the salt sea, from
which he has emerged to aid in the expulsion of the opposing spirits.
This being the information given to the candidate he assumes and
personates the character of the man´idō referred to, and being given a
bow and four arrows, and under the guidance of his preceptor, he
proceeds toward the main entrance of the structure while the officiating
priests enter and station themselves within the door facing the west.
The preceptor carries the remaining parcels of tobacco, and when the
candidate arrives near the door he makes four movements with his bow and
arrow toward the interior, as if shooting, the last time sending an
arrow within, upon which the grinning spirits are forced to retreat
toward the other end of the inclosure. The candidate then rushes in at
the main entrance, and upon emerging at the south suddenly turns and
again employs his bow and arrow four times toward the crowd of evil
man´idōs, who have rushed toward him during the interval that he was
within. At the last gesture of shooting into the inclosure, he sends
forward an arrow, deposits a parcel of tobacco and crouches to rest at
the so-called “bear’s nest.” During this period of repose the Midē´
priests continue to drum and sing. Then the candidate approaches the
southern door again, on all fours, and the moment he arrives there he
rises and is hurried through the inclosure to emerge at the west, where
he turns suddenly, and imitating the manner of shooting arrows into the
group of angry man´idōs within, he at the fourth movement lets fly an
arrow and gets down into the western “bear’s nest.” After a short
interval he again approaches the door, crawling forward on his hands and
knees until he reaches the entrance, where he leaves a present of
tobacco and is hastened through the inclosure to emerge at the northern
door, where he again turns suddenly upon the angry spirits, and after
making threatening movements toward them, at the fourth menace he sends
an arrow among them. The spirits are now greatly annoyed by the magic
power possessed by the candidate and the assistance rendered by the
Midē´
<span class="pagenum">263</span>
<a name="page263" id="page263"> </a>
<!--png 339-->
Man´idōs, so that they are compelled to seek safety in flight. The
candidate is resting in the northern “bear’s nest,” and as he again
crawls toward the Midē´wigân, on hands and knees, he deposits another
gift of a parcel of tobacco, then rises and is hurried through the
interior to emerge at the entrance door, where he turns around, and
seeing but a few angry man´idōs remaining, he takes his last arrow and
aiming it at them makes four threatening gestures toward them, at the
last sending the arrow into the structure, which puts to flight all
opposition on the part of this host of man´idōs. The path is now clear,
and after he deposits another gift of tobacco at the door he is led
within, and the preceptor receives the bow and deposits it with the
remaining tobacco upon the pile of blankets and robes that have by this
time been removed from the rafters and laid upon the ground midway
between the sacred Midē´ stone and the first Midē´ post.</p>

<p>The chief Midē´ priest then takes charge of the candidate,
saying:</p>

<table class="parallel" summary="line-by-line translation">

<p>To this the second Midē´ priest remarks to the candidate,
Wa´-shi-gân´-do-we-an´ mi-gai´-i-nŏk´ wa´-ka-no´-shi-dzin&mdash;which
freely translated signifies: “The reason I now advise you is that you
may heed him when he speaks to you.” The candidate is then led around
the interior of the inclosure, the assistant Midē´ fall in line of march
and are followed by all the others present, excepting the musicians.
During the circuit, which is performed slowly, the chief Midē´ drums
upon the Midē´ drum and chants. The following, reproduced from the
original, on <a href="#plateXVIIb">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVII</span>,&nbsp;B</a>, consists of a number of archaic
words, some of which are furthermore different from the spoken language

presents, thence left oblique to the south of the first-degree post,
then passing the second on the north, and so on until the last post is
reached, around which the course continues, and back in a similar
serpentine manner to the eastern door. The candidate is then led to the
blankets, upon which he seats himself, the four officiating priests
placing themselves before him, the preceptor standing back near the
first of the four degree posts.</p>

<p>The Midē´ priest of the fourth rank or place in order of precedence
approaches the kneeling candidate and in a manner similar to that which
has already been described shoots into his breast the mī´gis; the third,
second and first Midē´ follow in like manner, the last named alone
shooting his mī´gis into the candidate’s forehead, upon which he falls
forward, spits out a mī´gis shell which he had previously secreted in
his mouth, and upon the priests rubbing upon his back and limbs their
Midē´ sacks he recovers and resumes his sitting posture.</p>

<p>The officiating priests retire to either side of the inclosure to
find seats, when the newly received member arises and with the
assistance of the preceptor distributes the remaining parcels of
tobacco, and lastly the blankets, robes, and other gifts. He then begins
at the southeastern angle of the inclosure to return thanks for
admission, places both hands upon the first person, and as he moves them
downward over his hair says: Mi-gwĕtsh´ ga-o´-shi-tō´-ĭn
bi-mâ´-dĭ-sĭ-win&mdash;“Thanks, for giving to me life.” The Midē´
addressed bows his head and responds, hau´, ē<sup>n</sup>´,&mdash;yes
when the newly admitted member steps back one pace, clasps his hands and
inclines his head to the front. This movement is continued until all
present have been thanked, after which he takes a seat in the
southeastern corner of the inclosure.</p>

<p>A curious ceremony then takes place in which all the Midē´ on one
side of the inclosure arise and approach those upon the other, each
grasping his Midē´ sack and selecting a victim pretends to shoot into
his body the mī´gis, whereupon the Midē´ so shot falls over, and after a
brief attack of gagging and retching pretends to gain relief by spitting
out of his mouth a mī´gis shell. This is held upon the left palm, and as
the opposing party retreat to their seats, the side which has just been
subjected to the attack moves rapidly around among one another as if
dancing, but simply giving rapid utterance to the word hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´,
hŏ´, hŏ´, hŏ´, and showing the mī´gis to everybody present, after which
they place the flat hands quickly to the mouth and pretend again to
swallow their respective shells. The members of this party then
similarly attack their opponents, who
<span class="pagenum">266</span>
<a name="page266" id="page266"> </a>
<!--png 342-->
submit to similar treatment and go through like movements in exhibiting
the mī´gis, which they again swallow. When quiet has been restored, and
after a ceremonial smoke has been indulged in, the candidate sings, or
chants, the production being either his own composition or that of some
other person from whom it has been purchased. The chant presented
herewith was obtained from Sikas´sigĕ, who had received it in turn from
his father when the latter was chief priest of the Midē´wiwin at Mille
Lacs, Minnesota. The pictographic characters are reproduced on <a href="#plateXVIIa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVII</span>,&nbsp;A</a>,
and the musical notation, which is also presented, was obtained during
the period of my preliminary instruction. The phraseology of the chant,
of which each line and verse is repeated ad libitum as the singer may be
inspired, is as follows:</p>

<p>The following musical notation presents accurately the range of notes
employed by the preceptor. The peculiarity of Midē´ songs lies in the
fact that each person has his own individual series of notes which
correspond to the number of syllables in the phrase and add thereto
meaningless words to prolong the effect. When a song is taught, the
words are the chief and most important part, the musical rendering of a
second person may be so different from that of the person from whom he
learns it as to be unrecognizable without
<span class="pagenum">274</span>

the words. Another fact which often presents itself is the absence of
time and measure, which prevents any reduction to notation by full bars;
e.g., one or two bars may appear to consist of four quarter notes or a
sufficient number of quarters and eighths to complete such bars, but the
succeeding one may consist of an additional quarter, or perhaps two,
thus destroying all semblance of rythmic continuity. This peculiarity is
not so common in dancing music, in which the instruments of percussion
are employed to assist regularity and to accord with the steps made by
the dancers, or vice versa.</p>

<p>In some of the songs presented in this paper the bars have been
omitted for the reasons presented above. The peculiarity of the songs as
rendered by the preceptor is thus more plainly indicated.</p>

<p>When the chant is ended the ushers, who are appointed by the chief
Midē´, leave the inclosure to bring in the vessels of food. This is
furnished by the newly elected member and is prepared by his female
relatives and friends. The kettles and dishes of food are borne around
four times, so that each one present may have the opportunity of eating
sufficiently. Smoking and conversation relating to the Midē´wiwin may
then be continued until toward sunset, when, upon an intimation from the
chief Midē´, the members quietly retire, leaving the structure by the
western door. All personal property is removed, and upon the following
day everybody departs.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="fourth_desc" id="fourth_desc">
DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.</a></h5>

<p>The amount of influence wielded by Midē´ generally, and particularly
such as have received four degrees, is beyond belief. The rite of the
Midē´wiwin is deemed equivalent to a religion&mdash;as that term is
commonly understood by intelligent people&mdash;and is believed to
elevate such a Midē´ to the nearest possible approach to the reputed
character of Mi´nabō´zho, and to place within his reach the supernatural
power of invoking and communing with Ki´tshi Man´idō himself.</p>

<p>By reference to <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, No. 98, it will be observed that
the human figure is specially marked with very pronounced indications of
mī´gis spots upon the head, the extremities, and more particularly the
breast. These are placed where the mīgis was “shot” into the Midē´, and
the functions of the several parts are therefore believed to be greatly
augmented. All the spots are united by a line to denote unity and
harmony of action in the exercise of power.</p>

<p>The mī´gis, typical of the fourth degree, consists of small pieces of
deer horn, covered with red paint on one end and green upon the other.
Sometimes but one color is employed for the entire object. The form is
shown on <a href="#plateXI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XI</span></a>, No. 6. No. 2, upon the same plate,
represents a shell, used as a mī´gis, observed at White Earth.</p>

posts, as practiced by the several societies in Minnesota. Each society
claims to preserve the ancient method. The cross, shown in No. 7, bears
the typical colors&mdash;red and green&mdash;upon the upper half, while
the lower post is square and colored white on the east, green on the
south, red on the west, and black on the north. The Midē´ explain the
signification of the colors as follows: White represents the east, the
source of light and the direction from which the sacred mī´gis came;
green, sha´manō the southern one, refers to the source of the rains, the
direction from which the Thunderers come in the spring, they who
revivify the earth; red refers to the land of the setting sun, the abode
of the shadows or the dead; and north being black, because that is the
direction from which come cold, hunger, and disease.</p>

<p>The words of the Midē´ priest alluding to “the path that has no end”
refer to the future course and conduct of the candidate for the last
degree, as well as to the possibility of attaining unlimited powers in
magic, and is pictorially designated upon the chart on <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, at
No. 99. The path is devious and beset with temptations, but by strict
adherence to the principles of the Midē´wiwin the Midē´ may reach the
goal and become the superior of his confrères, designated
Mi-ni´-si-nō´-shkwe, “he who lives on the island.”</p>

<p>A Midē´-Wâbĕnō´ of this degree is dreaded on account of his
extraordinary power of inflicting injury, causing misfortune, etc., and
most remarkable tales are extant concerning his astounding performances
with fire.</p>

<p>The following performance is said to have occurred at White Earth,
Minnesota, in the presence of a large gathering of Indians and mixed
bloods. Two small wig´iwams were erected, about 50 paces from each
other, and after the Wâbĕnō´ had crawled into one of them his
disparagers built around each of them a continuous heap of brush and
firewood, which were then kindled. When the blaze was at its height all
became hushed for a moment, and presently the Wâbĕnō´ called to the
crowd that he had transferred himself to the other wig´iwam and
immediately, to their profound astonishment, crawled forth unharmed.</p>

<p>This is but an example of the numerous and marvelous abilities with
which the Wâbĕnō´ of the higher grade is accredited.</p>

<p>The special pretensions claimed by the Midē-Wâbĕnō´ have already been
mentioned, but an account of the properties and manner of using the
“love powder” may here be appropriate. This powder&mdash;the composition
of which has been given&mdash;is generally used by the owner to
accomplish results desired by the applicant. It is carried in a small
bag made of buckskin or cloth, which the Wâbĕnō´ carefully deposits
within his Midē´ sack, but which is transferred to another sack of like
size and loaned to the applicant, for a valuable consideration.</p>

During a recent visit to one of the reservations in Minnesota, I had
occasion to confer with a Catholic missionary regarding some of the
peculiar medical practices of the Indians, and the implements and other
accessories employed in connection with their profession. He related the
following incident as having but a short time previously come under his
own personal observation:</p>

<p>One of the members of his church, a Norwegian, sixty-two years of
age, and a widower, had for the last preceding year been considered by
most of the residents as demented. The missionary himself had observed
his erratic and frequently irrational conduct, and was impressed with
the probable truth of the prevailing rumor. One morning, however, as the
missionary was seated in his study, he was surprised to receive a very
early call, and upon invitation his visitor took a seat and explained
the object of his visit. He said that for the last year he had been so
disturbed in his peace of mind that he now came to seek advice. He was
fully aware of the common report respecting his conduct, but was utterly
unable to control himself, and attributed the cause of his unfortunate
condition to an occurrence of the year before. Upon waking one morning
his thoughts were unwillingly concentrated upon an Indian woman with
whom he had no personal acquaintance whatever, and, notwithstanding the
absurdity of the impression, he was unable to cast it aside. After
breakfast he was, by some inexplicable influence, compelled to call upon
her, and to introduce himself, and although he expected to be able to
avoid repeating the visit, he never had sufficient control over himself
to resist lurking in the vicinity of her habitation.</p>

<p>Upon his return home after the first visit he discovered lying upon
the floor under his bed, a Midē´ sack which contained some small parcels
with which he was unfamiliar, but was afterward told that one of them
consisted of “love powder.” He stated that he had grown children, and
the idea of marrying again was out of the question, not only on their
account but because he was now too old. The missionary reasoned with him
and suggested a course of procedure, the result of which had not been
learned when the incident was related.</p>

<p>Jugglery of another kind, to which allusion has before been made, is
also attributed to the highest class of Jĕs´sakkīd´. Several years ago
the following account was related to Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army,
and myself, and as Col. Mallery subsequently read a paper before the
Anthropological Society of Washington, District of Columbia, in which
the account was mentioned, I quote his words:</p>

<blockquote>Paul Beaulieu, an Ojibwa of mixed blood, present interpreter
at White Earth Agency, Minnesota, gave me his experience with a
Jĕs´sakkīd´, at Leech Lake, Minnesota, about the year 1858. The reports
of his wonderful performances had reached the agency, and as Beaulieu
had no faith in jugglers, he offered to wager
<span class="pagenum">277</span>
<a name="page277" id="page277"> </a>
<!--png 355-->
$100, a large sum, then and there, against goods of equal value, that
the juggler could not perform satisfactorily one of the tricks of his
repertoire to be selected by him (Beaulieu) in the presence of himself
and a committee of his friends. The Jĕs´sakkân´&mdash;or Jĕs´sakkīd´
lodge&mdash;was then erected. The framework of vertical poles, inclined
to the center, was filled in with interlaced twigs covered with blankets
and birch-bark from the ground to the top, leaving an upper orifice of
about a foot in diameter for the ingress and egress of spirits and the
objects to be mentioned, but not large enough for the passage of a man’s
body. At one side of the lower wrapping a flap was left for the entrance
of the Jĕs´sakkīd´.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A committee of twelve was selected to see that no
communication was possible between the Jĕs´sakkīd´ and confederates.
These were reliable people, one of them the Episcopal clergyman of the
reservation. The spectators were several hundred in number, but they
stood off, not being allowed to approach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ then removed his clothing, until nothing
remained but the breech-cloth. Beaulieu took a rope (selected by himself
for the purpose) and first tied and knotted one end about the juggler’s
ankles; his knees were then securely tied together, next the wrists,
after which the arms were passed over the knees and a billet of wood
passed through under the knees, thus securing and keeping the arms down
motionless. The rope was then passed around the neck, again and again,
each time tied and knotted, so as to bring the face down upon the knees.
A flat river-stone, of black color&mdash;which was the Jĕs´sakkīd´’s
ma´nidō or amulet&mdash;was left lying upon his thighs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Jĕs´sakkīd´ was then carried to the lodge and placed
inside upon a mat on the ground, and the flap covering was restored so
as to completely hide him from view.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately loud, thumping noises were heard, and the
framework began to sway from side to side with great violence; whereupon
the clergyman remarked that this was the work of the Evil One and ‘it
was no place for him,’ so he left and did not see the end. After a few
minutes of violent movements and swayings of the lodge accompanied by
loud inarticulate noises, the motions gradually ceased when the voice of
the juggler was heard, telling Beaulieu to go to the house of a friend,
near by, and get the rope. Now, Beaulieu, suspecting some joke was to be
played upon him, directed the committee to be very careful not to permit
any one to approach while he went for the rope, which he found at the
place indicated, still tied exactly as he had placed it about the neck
and extremities of the Jĕs´sakkīd´. He immediately returned, laid it
down before the spectators, and requested of the Jĕs´sakkīd´ to be
allowed to look at him, which was granted, but with the understanding
that Beaulieu was not to touch him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the covering was pulled aside, the Jĕs´sakkīd´ sat
within the lodge, contentedly smoking his pipe, with no other object in
sight than the black stone mánidō. Beaulieu paid his wager of
$100.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An exhibition of similar pretended powers, also for a wager,
was announced a short time after, at Yellow Medicine, Minnesota, to be
given in the presence of a number of Army people, but at the threat of
the Grand Medicine Man of the Leech Lake bands, who probably objected to
interference with his lucrative monopoly, the event did not take place
and bets were declared off.</blockquote>

<p>Col. Mallery obtained further information, of a similar kind from
various persons on the Bad River Reservation, and at Bayfield,
Wisconsin. All of these he considered to be mere variants of a class of
performances which were reported by the colonists of New England and the
first French missionaries in Canada as early as 1613, where the general
designation of “The Sorcerers” was applied to the whole body of Indians
on the Ottawa River. These reports, it must be

remembered, however, applied only to the numerous tribes of the
Algonkian linguistic family among which the alleged practices existed;
though neighboring tribes of other linguistic groups were no doubt
familiar with them, just as the Winnebago, Omaha, and other allied
tribes, profess to have “Medicine Societies,” the secrets of which they
claim to have obtained from tribes located east of their own habitat,
that practiced the peculiar ceremony of “shooting small shells” (i.e.,
the mī´gis of the Ojibwa) into the candidate.</p>

DZHIBAI´ MIDĒ´WIGÂN, OR “GHOST LODGE.”</a></h4>

<p>A structure erected by Indians for any purpose whatever, is now
generally designated a lodge, in which sense the term is applied in
connection with the word dzhibai´&mdash;ghost, or more appropriately
shadow&mdash;in the above caption. This lodge is constructed in a form
similar to that of the Midē´wigân, but its greatest diameter extends
north and south instead of east and west. Further reference will be made
to this in describing another method of conferring the initiation of the
first degree of the Midē´wiwin. This distinction is attained by first
becoming a member of the so-called “Ghost Society,” in the manner and
for the reason following:</p>

<p>After the birth of a male child it is customary to invite the friends
of the family to a feast, designating at the same time a Midē´ to serve
as godfather and to dedicate the child to some special pursuit in life.
The Midē´ is governed in his decision by visions, and it thus sometimes
happens that the child is dedicated to the “Grand Medicine,” i.e., he is
to be prepared to enter the society of the Midē´. In such a case the
parents prepare him by procuring a good preceptor, and gather together
robes, blankets, and other gifts to be presented at initiation.</p>

<p>Should this son die before the age of puberty, before which period it
is not customary to admit any one into the society, the father paints
his own face as before described, viz, red, with a green stripe
diagonally across the face from left to right, as in <a href="#plateVI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">VI</span></a>, No. 4, or red
with two short horizontal parallel bars in green upon the forehead as in
<a href="#plateVI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">VI</span></a>, No.
5, and announces to the chief Midē´ priest his intention of becoming
himself a member of the “Ghost Society” and his readiness to receive the
first degree of the Midē´wiwin, as a substitute for his deceased son.
Other members of the mourner’s family blacken the face, as shown on <a
href="#plateVII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">VII</span></a>,
No.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p>In due time a council of Midē´ priests is called, who visit the
wig´iwam of the mourner, where they partake of a feast, and the subject
of initiation is discussed. This wig´iwam is situated south and east

<p>The following is an explanation of the several characters:</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 1 represents the wig´iwam of the mourner, which has been erected in
the vicinity of the Midē´wigân, until after the ceremony of
initiation.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 2 is the path supposed to be taken by the shadow (spirit) of the
deceased; it leads westward to the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân; literally,
shadow-spirit wig´iwam.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 3, 4, 5, and 6, designate the places where the spirit plucks the
fruits referred to&mdash;respectively the strawberry, the blueberry, the
June cherries, and the plum.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 7 designates the form and location of the Dzhihai´ Midē´wigân. The
central spot is the place of the dish of food for Dzhibai´
Man´idō&mdash;the good spirit&mdash;and the smaller spots around the
interior of the inclosure are places for the deposit of dishes for the
other Midē´ spirits who have left this earth.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 8 is the path which is taken by the candidate when going from his
wig´iwam to the Midē´wigân.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 9 indicates the place of the sweat-lodge, resorted to at other
periods of initiation.</p>

<p class="hanging">
No. 10 is the Midē´wigân in which the ceremony is conducted at the
proper time.</p>

<p>It is stated that in former times the Ghost Lodge was erected west of
the location of the mourner’s wig´iwam, but for a long time this
practice has been discontinued. The tradition relating to the Spirit’s
progress is communicated orally, while the dramatic representation is
confined to placing the dishes of food in the Midē´wigân, which is
selected as a fitting and appropriate substitute during the night
preceding the initiation.</p>

<p>This custom, as it was practiced, consisted of carrying from the
mourner’s wig´iwam to the Ghost Lodge the dishes of food for the spirits
of departed Midē´ to enjoy a feast, during the time that the Midē´
priests were partaking of one. A large dish was placed in the center of
the structure by the mourner, from which the supreme Midē´ spirit was to
eat. Dishes are now carried to the Midē´wigân, as stated above.</p>

<p>The chief officiating Midē´ then instructs the father of the deceased
boy the manner in which he is to dress and proceed, as symbolizing the
course pursued by the spirit of the son on the way to the spirit

world. The instructions are carried out, as far as possible, with the
exception of going to an imaginary Ghost Lodge, as he proceeds only to
the Midē´wigân and deposits the articles enumerated below. He is told to
take one pair of bear-skin moccasins, one pair of wolf-skin, and one
pair of birds’ skins, in addition to those which he wears upon his feet;
these are to be carried to the structure in which the Midē´ spirits are
feasting, walking barefooted, picking a strawberry from a plant on the
right of the path and a blueberry from a bush on the left, plucking June
cherries from a tree on the right and plums on the left. He is then to
hasten toward the Ghost Lodge, which is covered with mī´gis, and to
deposit the fruit and the moccasins; these will be used by his son’s
spirit in traveling the road of the dead after the spirits have
completed their feast and reception of him. While the candidate is on
his mission to the Ghost Lodge (for the time being represented by the
Midē´wigân) the assemblage in the wig´iwam chant the following for the
mourner: Yan´-i-ma-tsha´, yan´-i-ma-tsha´, ha´, yan´-i-ma-tsha´
yan´-i-ma-tsha´ ha´, yu´-te-no-win´ gē´, hē´ nin-de´-so-ne´&mdash;“I am
going away, I am going away, I am going away, to the village I
walk”&mdash;i.e., the village of the dead.</p>

<p>The person who desires to receive initiation into the Midē´wigân,
under such circumstances, impersonates Minabō´zho, as he is believed to
have penetrated the country of the abode of shadows, or
ne´-ba-gī´-zis&mdash;“land of the sleeping sun.” He, it is said, did
this to destroy the “Ghost Gambler” and to liberate the many victims who
had fallen into his power. To be enabled to traverse this dark and
dismal path, he borrowed of Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the owl&mdash;his eyes,
and received also the services of <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘wē´-we-tē´-si-wŭg’">wâ´-wa-tē´-si-wŭg</ins>&mdash;the firefly,
both of which were sent back to the earth upon the completion of his
journey. By referring to <a href="#plateIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">III</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, the reference to this myth will be
observed as pictorially represented in Nos. 110 to 114. No. 110 is the
Midē´wigân from which the traveler has to visit the Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân
(No. 112) in the west. No. 113, represented as Kŏ-ko´-kŏ-ō´&mdash;the
owl&mdash;whose eyes enabled Mī´nabō´zho to follow the path of the dead
(No. 114); the owl skin Midē´ sack is also sometimes used by Midē´
priests who have received their first degree in this wise. The V-shaped
characters within the circle at No. 111 denote the presence of spirits
at the Ghost Lodge, to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>The presents which had been gathered as a gift or fee for the
deceased are now produced and placed in order for transportation to the
Midē´wigân, early on the following morning.</p>

<p>The Midē´ priests then depart, but on the next morning several of
them make their appearance to assist in clearing the Midē´wigân of the
dishes which had been left there over night, and to carry thither the
robes, blankets, and other presents, and suspend them from the rafters.
Upon their return to the candidate’s wig´iwam, the Midē´ priests gather,
and after the candidate starts to lead the procession
<span class="pagenum">281</span>
<a name="page281" id="page281"> </a>
<!--png 361-->
toward the Midē´wigân, the priests fall in in single file, and all move
forward, the Midē´ priests chanting the following words repeatedly, viz:
Ki-e´-ne-kwo-tâ´ ki-e´-ne-kwo-tâ´, ha´, ha´, ha´, nōs e´wi-e´, hē´,
ki´-na-ka´-ta-mŭn´ do-nâ´-gan&mdash;“I also, I also, my father, leave
you my dish.”</p>

<p>This is sung for the deceased, who is supposed to bequeath to his
father his dish, or other articles the names of which are sometimes
added.</p>

<p>The procession continues toward and into the Midē´wigân, passing
around the interior by the left side toward the west, north, and east to
a point opposite the space usually reserved for the deposit of goods,
where the candidate turns to the right and stands in the middle of the
inclosure, where he now faces the Midē´ post in the west. The members
who had not joined the procession, but who had been awaiting its
arrival, now resume their seats, and those who accompanied the candidate
also locate themselves as they desire, when the officiating priests
begin the ceremony as described in connection with the initiation for
the first degree after the candidate has been turned over to the chief
by the preceptor.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mother of one who had been so dedicated to the
Midē´wiwin is taken into that society, particularly when the father is
absent or dead.</p>


<h5 class="section"><a name="subst" id="subst">
INITIATION BY SUBSTITUTION.</a></h5>

<p>It sometimes happens that a sick person can not be successfully
treated by the Midē´, especially in the wig´iwam of the patient, when it
becomes necessary for the latter to be carried to the Midē´wigân and the
services of the society to be held. This course is particularly followed
when the sick person or the family can furnish a fee equivalent to the
gift required for initiation under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>It is believed, under such conditions, that the evil man´idōs can be
expelled from the body only in the sacred structure, at which place
alone the presence of Ki´tshi Man´idō may be felt, after invocation, and
in return for his aid in prolonging the life of the patient the latter
promises his future existence to be devoted to the practice and
teachings of the Midē´wiwin. Before proceeding further, however, it is
necessary to describe the method pursued by the Midē´ priest.</p>

<p>The first administrations may consist of mashki´kiwabū<sup>n</sup>´,
or medicine broth, this being the prescription of the Midē´ in the
capacity of mashki´kike´winĭ´nĭ, or herbalist, during which medication
he resorts to incantation and exorcism, accompanying his song by liberal
use of the rattle. As an illustration of the songs used at this period
of the illness, the following is presented, the mnemonic characters
being reproduced on <a href="#plateXVIc">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;C</a>. The singing is monotonous and
doleful, though at times it becomes animated and discordant.</p>

When the ordinary course of treatment fails to relieve the patient the
fact is made known to the Midē´ priests and he is consequently taken to
the Midē´wigân and laid upon blankets so that part of his body may rest
against the sacred midē´ stone. Associate Midē´ then attend, in
consultation, with the Midē´-in-chief, the other members present
occupying seats around the walls of the structure.</p>

<p>The accompanying lecture is then addressed to the sick person,
viz:</p>

<blockquote>Mi-shosh´-yâ-gwa´ ga´-a-nin-nan´ gi´-de-wēn´-du-nŭn
ne´-tun-ga´-da-da-we´-in man´-i-dōmī´-gis. Kit´-ti-mâ´-gĭ-si

bi-mâ-di-si-wĭn´.</blockquote>

<p>The following is a free translation of the above:</p>

<blockquote>The time of which I spoke to you has now arrived, and you
may deem it necessary to first borrow the sacred mī´gis. Who are you
that comes here as a supplicant? Sit down opposite to me, where I can
see you and speak to you, and fix your attention upon me, while you
receive life you must not permit your thoughts to dwell upon your
present condition, but to support yourself against falling into
despondency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now we are ready to try him; now we are ready to initiate
him.</blockquote>

<p>The reference to borrowing a mī´gis signifies that the patient may
have this mysterious power “shot into his body” where he lies upon the
ground and before he has arrived at the place where candidates are
properly initiated; this, because of his inability to walk round the
inclosure.</p>

<p>The last sentence is spoken to the assisting Midē´. The following
song is sung, the mnemonic characters pertaining thereto being

<p>If the patient becomes strong enough to walk round the inclosure he
is led to the western end and seated upon a blanket, where he is
initiated. If not, the mī´gis is “shot into his body” as he reclines
against the sacred stone, after which a substitute is selected from
among the Midē´ present, who takes his place and goes through the
remainder of the initiation for him. Before proceeding upon either
course, however, the chief attendant Midē´ announces his readiness in
the following manner: Mi´-o-shi´-gwa, wi-kwod´-gi-o-wŏg´
ga-mâ´-dzhi-a-ka´-dŭng bi-mâ-di-si-wĭn´&mdash;“Now we are ready to
escape from this and to begin to watch life.” This signifies his desire
to escape from his present procedure and to advance to another course of
action, to the exercise of the power of giving life by transferring the
sacred mī´gis.</p>

<p>The remainder of the ceremony is then conducted as in the manner
described as pertains to the first degree of the Midē´wiwin.</p>

<p>Before concluding, it may be of interest to refer in some detail to
several subjects mentioned in the preceding pages. The mnemonic songs
are in nearly every instance incised upon birch bark by means of a
sharp-pointed piece of bone or a nail. The inner surface of the bark is
generally selected because it is softer than the reverse. Bark for such
purposes is peeled from the trunk during the spring months. On the right
hand upper corner of <a href="#plateXIX">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XIX</span></a> is reproduced a portion
<span class="pagenum">287</span>
<a name="page287" id="page287"> </a>

of a mnemonic song showing characters as thus drawn. The specimen was
obtained at White Earth, and the entire song is presented on <a href="#plateXVIc">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XVI</span>,&nbsp;C</a>. A
piece of bark obtained at Red Lake, and known to have been incised more
than seventy years ago, is shown on the right lower corner of <a href="#plateXIX">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">XIX</span></a>. The
drawings are upon the outer surface and are remarkably deep and
distinct. The left hand specimen is from the last named locality, and of
the same period, and presents pictographs drawn upon the inner
surface.</p>

Plate XIX. Sacred Birch Bark Records.</p>

<p>In a majority of songs the characters are drawn so as to be read from
left to right, in some from right to left, and occasionally one is found
to combine both styles, being truly boustrophic. Specimens have been
obtained upon which the characters were drawn around and near the margin
of an oblong piece of bark, thus appearing in the form of an irregular
circle.</p>

<p>The pictographic delineation of ideas is found to exist chiefly among
the shamans, hunters, and travelers of the Ojibwa, and there does not
appear to be a recognized system by which the work of any one person is
fully intelligible to another. A record may be recognized as pertaining
to the Midē´ ceremonies, as a song used when hunting plants, etc.; but
it would be impossible for one totally unfamiliar with the record to
state positively whether the initial character was at the left or the
right hand. The figures are more than simply mnemonic; they are
ideographic, and frequently possess additional interest from the fact
that several ideas are expressed in combination. Col. Garrick Mallery,
U.S. Army, in a paper entitled “Recently Discovered Algonkian
Pictographs,” read before the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Cleveland, 1888, expressed this fact in the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>It is desirable to explain the mode of using the Midē´ and
other bark records of the Ojibwa and also those of other Algonkian
tribes to be mentioned in this paper. The comparison made by Dr.
E.&nbsp;B. Tylor of the pictorial alphabet to teach children “A was an
archer,” etc., is not strictly appropriate in this case. The devices are
not only mnemonic, but are also ideographic and descriptive. They are
not merely invented to express or memorize the subject, but are evolved
therefrom. To persons acquainted with secret societies a good comparison
for the charts or rolls would be what is called the tressel board of the
Masonic order, which is printed and published and publicly exposed
without exhibiting any of the secrets of the order, yet is not only
significant, but useful to the esoteric in assistance to their memory as
to degrees and details of ceremony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A more general mode of explaining the so-called symbolism is
by a suggestion that the charts of the order or the song of a myth
should be likened to the popular illustrated poems and songs lately
published in Harper’s Magazine for instance, “Sally in our Alley,” where
every stanza has an appropriate illustration. Now, suppose that the text
was obliterated forever, indeed the art of reading lost, the
illustrations remaining, as also the memory to many persons of the
ballad. The illustrations kept in order would supply always the order of
the stanzas and also the general subject-matter of each particular
stanza and the latter would be a reminder of the words. This is what the
rolls of birch bark do to the initiated Ojibwa, and what Schoolcraft
pretended in some cases to show, but what for actual
<span class="pagenum">288</span>
<a name="page288" id="page288"> </a>
<!--png 370-->
understanding requires that all the vocables of the actual songs and
charges of the initiation should be recorded and translated. This
involves not only profound linguistic study, but the revelation of all
the mysteries. In other instances the literation in the aboriginal
language of the nonesoteric songs and stories and their translation is
necessary to comprehend the devices by which they are memorized rather
than symbolized. Nevertheless, long usage has induced some degree of
ideography and symbolism.</blockquote>

Plate XX. Sacred Bark Scroll And Contents.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateXX">Pl.&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">XX</span></a> are presented illustrations of several
articles found in a Midē´ sack which had been delivered to the Catholic
priest at Red Lake over seventy years ago, when the owner professed
Christianity and forever renounced (at least verbally) his pagan
profession. The information given below was obtained from Midē´ priests
at the above locality. They are possessed of like articles, being
members of the same society to which the late owners of the relics
belonged. The first is a birch-bark roll, the ends of which were slit
into short strips, so as to curl in toward the middle to prevent the
escaping of the contents. The upper figure is that of the Thunder god,
with waving lines extending forward from the eyes, denoting the power of
peering into futurity. This character has suggested to several Midē´
priests that the owner might have been a Midē´-Jĕs´sakkīd´. This belief
is supported by the actual practice pursued by this class of priests
when marking their personal effects. The lower figure is that of a
buffalo, as is apparent from the presence of the hump. Curiously enough
both eyes are drawn upon one side of the head, a practice not often
followed by Indian artists.</p>

<p>The upper of the four small figures is a small package, folded,
consisting of the inner sheet of birch-bark and resembling paper both in
consistence and color. Upon the upper fold is the outline of the Thunder
bird. The next two objects represent small boxes made of pine wood,
painted or stained red and black. They were empty when received, but
were no doubt used to hold sacred objects. The lowest figure of the four
consists of a bundle of three small bags of cotton wrapped with a strip
of blue cloth. The bags contain, respectively, love powder, hunter’s
medicine&mdash;in this instance red ocher and powdered arbor vitæ
leaves&mdash;and another powder of a brownish color, with which is mixed
a small quantity of ground medicinal plants.</p>

<p>The roll of birch-bark containing these relics inclosed also the skin
of a small rodent (Spermophilus sp.?) but in a torn and moth-eaten
condition. This was used by the owner for purposes unknown to those who
were consulted upon the subject. It is frequently, if not generally,
impossible to ascertain the use of most of the fetiches and other sacred
objects contained in Midē´ sacks of unknown ownership, as each priest
adopts his own line of practice, based upon a variety of reasons,
chiefly the nature of his fasting dreams.</p>

are of curious shape or bear designs of odd form copied after

something of European origin, as exemplified in the specimen illustrated
on. <a href="#plateXXI">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XXI</span></a>,
Nos. 1 and 2, showing both the obverse and reverse. The specimen is made
of ash wood and measures about ten inches in length. On the obverse
side, besides the figures of man´-idōs, such as the Thunder bird, the
serpent, and the tortoise, there is the outline of the sun, spots copied
from playing cards, etc.; upon the reverse appear two spread hands, a
bird, and a building, from the top of which floats the American flag.
This specimen was found among the effects of a Midē´ who died at Leech
Lake, Minnesota, a few years ago, together with effigies and other
relics already mentioned in another part of this paper.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="music" id="music">
MUSIC.</a></h5>

<p>In addition to the examples of Indian music that have been given,
especially the songs of shamans, it may be of interest to add a few
remarks concerning the several varieties of songs or chants. Songs
employed as an accompaniment to dances are known to almost all the
members of the tribe, so that their rendition is nearly always the same.
Such songs are not used in connection with mnemonic characters, as there
are, in most instances, no words or phrases recited, but simply a
continued repetition of meaningless words or syllables. The notes are
thus rhythmically accentuated, often accompanied by beats upon the drum
and the steps of the dancers.</p>

<p>An example of another variety of songs, or rather chants, is
presented in connection with the reception of the candidate by the Midē´
priest upon his entrance into the Midē´wigân of the first degree. In
this instance words are chanted, but the musical rendition differs with
the individual, each Midē´ chanting notes of his own, according to his
choice or musical ability. There is no set formula, and such songs, even
if taught to others, are soon distorted by being sung according to the
taste or ability of the singer. The musical rendering of the words and
phrases relating to the signification of mnemonic characters depends
upon the ability and inspired condition of the singer; and as each Midē´
priest usually invents and prepares his own songs, whether for
ceremonial purposes, medicine hunting, exorcism, or any other use, he
may frequently be unable to sing them twice in exactly the same manner.
Love songs and war songs, being of general use, are always sung in the
same style of notation.</p>

<p>The emotions are fully expressed in the musical rendering of the
several classes of songs, which are, with few exceptions, in a minor
key. Dancing and war songs are always in quick time, the latter
frequently becoming extraordinarily animated and boisterous as the
participants become more and more excited.</p>

<p>Midē´ and other like songs are always more or less monotonous, though
they are sometimes rather impressive, especially if delivered
<span class="pagenum">290</span>
<a name="page290" id="page290"> </a>
<!--png 374-->
by one sufficiently emotional and possessed of a good voice. Some of the
Midē´ priests employ few notes, not exceeding a range of five, for all
songs, while others frequently cover the octave, terminating with a
final note lower still.</p>

<p>The statement has been made that one Midē´ is unable either to recite
or sing the proper phrase pertaining to the mnemonic characters of a
song belonging to another Midē´ unless specially instructed. The
representation of an object may refer to a variety of ideas of a
similar, though not identical, character. The picture of a bear may
signify the Bear man´idō as one of the guardians of the society; it may
pertain to the fact that the singer impersonates that man´idō; exorcism
of the malevolent bear spirit may be thus claimed; or it may relate to
the desired capture of the animal, as when drawn to insure success for
the hunter. An Indian is slow to acquire the exact phraseology, which is
always sung or chanted, of mnemonic songs recited to him by a Midē´
preceptor.</p>

<p>An exact reproduction is implicitly believed to be necessary, as
otherwise the value of the formula would be impaired, or perhaps even
totally destroyed. It frequently happens, therefore, that although an
Indian candidate for admission into the Mīdē´wiwin may already have
prepared songs in imitation of those from which he was instructed, he
may either as yet be unable to sing perfectly the phrases relating
thereto, or decline to do so because of a want of confidence. Under such
circumstances the interpretation of a record is far from satisfactory,
each character being explained simply objectively, the true import being
intentionally or unavoidably omitted. An Ojibwa named “Little
Frenchman,” living at Red Lake, had received almost continuous
instruction for three or four years, and although he was a willing and
valuable assistant in other matters pertaining to the subject under
consideration, he was not sufficiently familiar with some of his
preceptor’s songs to fully explain them. A few examples of such mnemonic
songs are presented in illustration, and for comparison with such as
have already been recorded. In each instance the Indian’s interpretation
of the character is given first, the notes in brackets being supplied in
further explanation. <a href="#plateXXIIa">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XXII</span>,&nbsp;A</a>, is reproduced from a birch-bark
song; the incised lines are sharp and clear, while the drawing in

has been made in connection with effigies and beads employed by Midē´ in
the endeavor to prove the genuineness of their religion and profession.
These <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘menmonic’">mnemonic</ins>
songs were exhibited to many Midē´ priests
from various portions of the Ojibwa country, in the hope of obtaining
some satisfactory explanation regarding the import of the several
characters; but, although they were pronounced to be “Grand Medicine,”
no suggestions were offered beyond the merest repetition of the name of
the object or what it probably was meant to represent. The direction of
their order was mentioned, because in most instances the initial
character furnishes the guide. Apart from this, the illustrations are of
interest as exhibiting the superior character and cleverness of their
execution.</p>

<p>The initial character on <a href="#fig36">Fig.&nbsp;36</a> appears
to be at the right hand upper corner, and represents the Bear Man´idō.
The third figure is that of the Midē´wiwin, with four man´idōs within
it, probably the guardians of the four degrees. The owner of the song
was a Midē´ of the second degree, as was stated in connection with his
Midē´wi-gwas or “medicine chart,” illustrated on Plate III,&nbsp;C.</p>

<p><a href="#fig38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a> seems to pertain to hunting, and
may have been recognized as a hunter’s chart. According to the belief of
several Midē´, it is lead from right to left, the human figure
indicating the direction according to the way in which the heads of the
crane, bear, etc., are turned. The lower left hand figure of a man has
five marks upon the breast, which probably indicate mī´gis spots, to
denote the power of magic influence possessed by the recorder.</p>

<p>The characters on <a href="#fig39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a> are found to be
arranged so as to read from the right hand upper corner toward the left,
the next line continuing to the right and lastly again to the left,
terminating with the figure of a Midē´ with the mī´gis upon his breast.
This is interesting on account of the boustrophic system of delineating
the figures, and also because such instances are rarely found to
occur.</p>

DRESS AND ORNAMENTS.</a></h5>

<p>While it is customary among many tribes of Indians to use as little
clothing as possible when engaged in dancing, either of a social or
ceremonial nature, the Ojibwa, on the contrary, vie with one another in
the attempt to appear in the most costly and gaudy dress attainable. The
Ojibwa Midē´ priests, take particular pride in their appearance when
attending ceremonies of the Midē´ Society, and seldom fail to impress
this fact upon visitors, as some of the Dakotan tribes, who have adopted
similar medicine ceremonies after the custom of their Algonkian
neighbors, are frequently without any clothing other than the
breechcloth and moccasins, and the armlets and other attractive
ornaments. This disregard of dress appears, to the Ojibwa, as a
sacrilegious digression from the ancient usages, and it frequently
excites severe comment.</p>

<p>Apart from facial ornamentation, of such design as may take the
actor’s fancy, or in accordance with the degree of which the subject may
be a member, the Midē´ priests wear shirts, trousers, and moccasins, the
first two of which may consist of flannel or cloth and be either plain
or ornamented with beads, while the latter are always of buckskin, or,
what is more highly prized, moose skin, beaded or worked with colored
porcupine quills.</p>

Midē´ Dancing Garters.</td>

<p>Immediately below each knee is tied a necessary item of an Ojibwa’s
dress, a garter, which consists of a band of beads varying in different
specimens from 2 to 4 inches in width, and from 18 to 20 inches in
length, to each end of which strands of colored wool yarn, 2 feet long,
are attached so as to admit of being passed around the leg and tied in a
bow-knot in front. These garters are made by the women in such patterns
as they may be able to design or elaborate. On <a href="#plateXXIII">Pl. <span class="smallroman">XXIII</span></a> are
reproductions of parts of two patterns which are of more than ordinary
interest, because of the symbolic signification of the colors and the
primitive art design in one, and the substitution of colors and the
introduction of modern designs in the other. The upper one consists of
green, red, and white beads, the first two colors being in accord with
those of one of the degree posts, while the white is symbolical of the
mī´gis shell. In the lower illustration is found a substitution of color
for the preceding, accounted for by the Midē´ informants, who explained
that neither of the varieties of beads of the particular color desired
could be obtained when wanted. The yellow beads are substituted for
white, the blue for green, and the orange and pink for red. The design
retains the lozenge form, though in a different arrangement, and the
introduction of the blue border is adapted after patterns observed among
their white neighbors. In the former is presented also what the Ojibwa
term the groundwork or type of their original style of ornamentation,
i.e., wavy or gently zigzag lines. Later art work consists
<span class="pagenum">299</span>
<a name="page299" id="page299"> </a>
<!--png 389-->
chiefly of curved lines, and this has gradually become modified through
instruction from the Catholic sisters at various early mission
establishments until now, when there has been brought about a common
system of working upon cloth or velvet, in patterns, consisting of
vines, leaves, and flowers, often exceedingly attractive though not
aboriginal in the true sense of the word.</p>

<p>Bands of flannel or buckskin, handsomely beaded, are sometimes
attached to the sides of the pantaloons, in imitation of an officer’s
stripes, and around the bottom. Collars are also used, in addition to
necklaces of claws, shells, or other objects.</p>

<p>Armlets and bracelets are sometimes made of bands of beadwork, though
brass wire or pieces of metal are preferred.</p>

<p>Bags made of cloth, beautifully ornamented or entirely covered with
beads, are worn, supported at the side by means of a broad band or
baldric passing over the opposite shoulder. The head is decorated with
disks of metal and tufts of colored horse hair or moose hair and with
eagle feathers to designate the particular exploits performed by the
wearer.</p>

<p>Few emblems of personal valor or exploits are now worn, as many of
the representatives of the present generation have never been actively
engaged in war, so that there is generally found only among the older
members the practice of wearing upon the head eagle feathers bearing
indications of significant markings or cuttings. A feather which has
been split from the tip toward the middle denotes that the wearer was
wounded by an arrow. A red spot as large as a silver dime painted upon a
feather shows the wearer to have been wounded by a bullet. The privilege
of wearing a feather tipped with red flannel or horse hair dyed red is
recognized only when the wearer has killed an enemy, and when a great
number have been killed in war the so-called war bonnet is worn, and may
consist of a number of feathers exceeding the number of persons killed,
the idea to be expressed being “a great number,” rather than a specific
enumeration.</p>

<p>Although the Ojibwa admit that in former times they had many other
specific ways of indicating various kinds of personal exploits, they now
have little opportunity of gaining such distinction, and consequently
the practice has fallen into desuetude.</p>

<h5 class="section"><a name="future" id="future">
FUTURE OF THE SOCIETY.</a></h5>

<p>According to a treaty now being made between the United States
Government and the Ojibwa Indians, the latter are to relinquish the
several areas of land at present occupied by them and to remove to
portions of the Red Lake and White Earth Reservations and take lands in
severalty. By this treaty about 4,000,000 acres of land will be ceded to
the Government, and the members of the various bands will become
citizens of the United States, and thus their tribal ties
<span class="pagenum">300</span>
<a name="page300" id="page300"> </a>
<!--png 390-->
will be broken and their primitive customs and rites be abandoned.</p>

<p>The chief Midē´ priests, being aware of the momentous consequences of
such a change in their habits, and foreseeing the impracticability of
much longer continuing the ceremonies of so-called “pagan rites,” became
willing to impart them to me, in order that a complete description might
be made and preserved for the future information of their
descendants.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any doubt that these ceremonies will still be
secretly held at irregular intervals; but under the watchful care of the
national authorities it is doubtful whether they will be performed with
any degree of completeness, and it will be but a comparatively short
time before the Midē´wiwin will be only a tradition.</p>

<h4><a name="midinote" id="midinote">Note on MIDI Files</a></h4>

<p>Depending on your browser, the MIDI files accompanying each piece of
music may play when clicked, or may need to be downloaded and played in
a separate application.</p>

<p>The “music” directory containing the MIDI samples also includes the
musical notation in Lilypond (.ly) format. If you have the Lilypond
application (free) installed, these files can be used to generate
free-standing pdf files. These are simplified versions of the songs,
omitting lyrics and dynamic marks. The meter is as printed, except that
most songs marked 6/8 were changed to 3/4.</p>

<p>Please note that these sound files are meant only to give a rough
approximation of each melody. All musical selections were originally
vocal, some with drum accompaniment. The three MIDI “instruments” were
selected to offer the user a choice of sounds, and are not intended to
be authentic.</p>

<h1>SACRED FORMULAS OF THE CHEROKEES.</h1>

<hr class="short">
<h3 class="sc">By James Mooney.</h3>
<hr class="short">

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The sacred formulas here given are selected from a collection of
about six hundred, obtained on the Cherokee reservation in North
Carolina in 1887 and 1888, and covering every subject pertaining to
the daily life and thought of the Indian, including medicine, love,
hunting, fishing, war, self-protection, destruction of enemies, witchcraft,
the crops, the council, the ball play, etc., and, in fact, embodying
almost the whole of the ancient religion of the Cherokees. The
original manuscripts, now in the possession of the Bureau of Ethnology,
were written by the shamans of the tribe, for their own use,
in the Cherokee characters invented by Sikwâ´ya (Sequoyah) in 1821,
and were obtained, with the explanations, either from the writers
themselves or from their surviving relatives.</p>

<p>Some of these manuscripts are known to be at least thirty years
old, and many are probably older. The medical formulas of all
kinds constitute perhaps one-half of the whole number, while the
love charms come next in number, closely followed by the songs and
prayers used in hunting and fishing. The great number of love
charms will doubtless be a surprise to those who have been educated
in the old theory that the Indian is insensible to the attractions of
woman. The comparatively small number of war formulas is explained
by the fact that the last war in which the Cherokees, as a
tribe, were engaged on their own account, closed with the Revolutionary
period, so that these things were well nigh forgotten before
the invention of the alphabet, a generation later. The Cherokees
who engaged in the Creek war and the late American civil war
fought in the interests of the whites, and their leaders were subordinated
to white officers, hence there was not the same opportunity for
the exercise of shamanistic rites that there would have been had
Indians alone been concerned. The prayers for hunting, fishing, and
the ball play being in more constant demand, have been better
preserved.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308">[pg 308]</a></span>

<p>These formulas had been handed down orally from a remote antiquity
until the early part of the present century, when the invention
of the Cherokee syllabary enabled the priests of the tribe to put
them into writing. The same invention made it possible for their
rivals, the missionaries, to give to the Indians the Bible in their own
language, so that the opposing forces of Christianity and shamanism
alike profited by the genius of Sikwâya. The pressure of the
new civilization was too strong to be withstood, however, and
though the prophets of the old religion still have much influence
with the people, they are daily losing ground and will soon be without
honor in their own country.</p>

<p>Such an exposition of the aboriginal religion could be obtained
from no other tribe in North America, for the simple reason that no
other tribe has an alphabet of its own in which to record its sacred
lore. It is true that the Crees and Micmacs of Canada and the Tukuth
of Alaska have so-called alphabets or ideographic systems invented
for their use by the missionaries, while, before the Spanish conquest,
the Mayas of Central America were accustomed to note down their
hero legends and priestly ceremonials in hieroglyphs graven upon
the walls of their temples or painted upon tablets made of the leaves
of the maguey. But it seems never to have occurred to the northern
tribes that an alphabet coming from a missionary source could be
used for any other purpose than the transcription of bibles and catechisms,
while the sacred books of the Mayas, with a few exceptions,
have long since met destruction at the hands of fanaticism, and the
modern copies which have come down to the present day are written
out from imperfect memory by Indians who had been educated under
Spanish influences in the language, alphabet and ideas of the conquerors,
and who, as is proved by an examination of the contents of the
books themselves, drew from European sources a great part of their
material. Moreover, the Maya tablets were so far hieratic as to be
understood only by the priests and those who had received a special
training in this direction, and they seem therefore to have been
entirely unintelligible to the common people.</p>

<p>The Cherokee alphabet, on the contrary, is the invention or adaptation
of one of the tribe, who, although he borrowed most of the
Roman letters, in addition to the forty or more characters of his own
devising, knew nothing of their proper use or value, but reversed
them or altered their forms to suit his purpose, and gave them a
name and value determined by himself. This alphabet was at once
adopted by the tribe for all purposes for which writing can be used,
including the recording of their shamanistic prayers and ritualistic
ceremonies. The formulas here given, as well as those of the entire
collection, were written out by the shamans themselves&mdash;men who
adhere to the ancient religion and speak only their native
language&mdash;in order that their sacred knowledge might be preserved
in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309">[pg 309]</a></span>
systematic manner for their mutual benefit. The language, the conception,
and the execution are all genuinely Indian, and hardly a dozen
lines of the hundreds of formulas show a trace of the influence of the
white man or his religion. The formulas contained in these manuscripts
are not disjointed fragments of a system long since extinct,
but are the revelation of a living faith which still has its priests and
devoted adherents, and it is only necessary to witness a ceremonial
ball play, with its fasting, its going to water, and its mystic bead
manipulation, to understand how strong is the hold which the old
faith yet has upon the minds even of the younger generation. The
numerous archaic and figurative expressions used require the interpretation
of the priests, but, as before stated, the alphabet in which
they are written is that in daily use among the common people.</p>

<p>In all tribes that still retain something of their ancient organization
we find this sacred knowledge committed to the keeping of various
secret societies, each of which has its peculiar ritual with regular
initiation and degrees of advancement. From this analogy we may
reasonably conclude that such was formerly the case with the Cherokees
also, but by the breaking down of old customs consequent
upon their long contact with the whites and the voluntary adoption
of a civilized form of government in 1827, all traces of such society
organization have long since disappeared, and at present each
priest or shaman is isolated and independent, sometimes confining
himself to a particular specialty, such as love or medicine, or even
the treatment of two or three diseases, in other cases broadening his
field of operations to include the whole range of mystic knowledge.</p>

<p>It frequently happens, however, that priests form personal friendships
and thus are led to divulge their secrets to each other for their
mutual advantage. Thus when one shaman meets another who he
thinks can probably give him some valuable information, he says
to him, “Let us sit down together.” This is understood by the other
to mean, “Let us tell each other our secrets.” Should it seem probable
that the seeker after knowledge can give as much as he receives,
an agreement is generally arrived at, the two retire to some convenient
spot secure from observation, and the first party begins by
reciting one of his formulas with the explanations. The other then
reciprocates with one of his own, unless it appears that the bargain
is apt to prove a losing one, in which case the conference comes to
an abrupt ending.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to obtain a formula by the payment of a
coat, a quantity of cloth, or a sum of money. Like the Celtic Druids
of old, the candidate for the priesthood in former times found it necessary
to cultivate a long memory, as no formula was repeated more
than once for his benefit. It was considered that one who failed to
remember after the first hearing was not worthy to be accounted a
shaman. This task, however, was not so difficult as might appear on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310">[pg 310]</a></span>
first thought, when once the learner understood the theory involved,
as the formulas are all constructed on regular principles, with constant
repetition of the same set of words. The obvious effect of
such a regulation was to increase the respect in which this sacred
knowledge was held by restricting it to the possession of a chosen few.</p>

<p>Although the written formulas can be read without difficulty by
any Cherokee educated in his own language, the shamans take good
care that their sacred writings shall not fall into the hands of the
laity or of their rivals in occult practices, and in performing the ceremonies
the words used are uttered in such a low tone of voice as to
be unintelligible even to the one for whose benefit the formula is
repeated. Such being the case, it is in order to explain how the
formulas collected were obtained.</p>

<h3>HOW THE FORMULAS WERE OBTAINED.</h3>

<p>On first visiting the reservation in the summer of 1887, I devoted
considerable time to collecting plants used by the Cherokees for
food or medicinal purposes, learning at the same time their Indian
names and the particular uses to which each was applied and the
mode of preparation. It soon became evident that the application
of the medicine was not the whole, and in fact was rather the subordinate,
part of the treatment, which was always accompanied by
certain ceremonies and “words.” From the workers employed at
the time no definite idea could be obtained as to the character of these
words. One young woman, indeed, who had some knowledge of the
subject, volunteered to write the words which she used in her prescriptions,
but failed to do so, owing chiefly to the opposition of the
half-breed shamans, from whom she had obtained her information.</p>

<h3>THE SWIMMER MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>Some time afterward an acquaintance was formed with a man
named A‘yû<sup>n</sup>´inĭ or “Swimmer,” who proved to be so intelligent that
I spent several days with him, procuring information in regard to
myths and old customs. He told a number of stories in very good
style, and finally related the Origin of the Bear<a class="tag" name="tag131" id="tag131" href="#note131">131</a> . The bears were
formerly a part of the Cherokee tribe who decided to leave their
kindred and go into the forest. Their friends followed them and
endeavored to induce them to return, but the Ani-Tsâ´kahĭ, as they
were called, were determined to go. Just before parting from their
relatives at the edge of the forest, they turned to them and said, “It
is better for you that we should go; but we will teach you songs,
and some day when you are in want of food come out to the woods
and sing these songs and we shall appear and give you meat.” Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311">[pg 311]</a></span>
friends, after learning several songs from them, started back to their
homes, and after proceeding a short distance, turned around to take
one last look, but saw only a number of bears disappearing in the
depths of the forest. The songs which they learned are still sung
by the hunter to attract the bears.</p>

FACSIMILE OF GAHUNI MANUSCRIPT.<br>
Formula for Didù<sup>n</sup>lĕckĭ. (Page <a href="#page349">349</a>.)
</div>

<p>When Swimmer had finished the story he was asked if he knew
these songs. He replied that he did, but on being requested to sing
one he made some excuse and was silent. After some further efforts
the interpreter said it would be useless to press the matter then as
there were several other Indians present, but that to-morrow we
should have him alone with us and could then make another attempt.</p>

<p>The next day Swimmer was told that if he persisted in his refusal
it would be necessary to employ some one else, as it was unfair in
him to furnish incomplete information when he was paid to tell all
he knew. He replied that he was willing to tell anything in regard
to stories and customs, but that these songs were a part of his secret
knowledge and commanded a high price from the hunters, who
sometimes paid as much as $5 for a single song, “because you can’t
kill any bears or deer unless you sing them.”</p>

<p>He was told that the only object in asking about the songs was to
put them on record and preserve them, so that when he and the half
dozen old men of the tribe were dead the world might be aware how
much the Cherokees had known. This appeal to his professional
pride proved effectual, and when he was told that a great many similar
songs had been sent to Washington by medicine men of other
tribes, he promptly declared that he knew as much as any of them,
and that he would give all the information in his possession, so that
others might be able to judge for themselves who knew most.
The only conditions he made were that these secret matters should
be heard by no one else but the interpreter, and should not be discussed
when other Indians were present.</p>

<p>As soon as the other shamans learned what was going on they endeavored
by various means to persuade him to stop talking, or failing
in this, to damage his reputation by throwing out hints as to his
honesty or accuracy of statement. Among other objections which
they advanced was one which, however incomprehensible to a white
man, was perfectly intelligible to an Indian, viz: That when he had
told everything this information would be taken to Washington and
locked up there, and thus they would be deprived of the knowledge.
This objection was one of the most difficult to overcome, as there
was no line of argument with which to oppose it.</p>

<p>These reports worried Swimmer, who was extremely sensitive in
regard to his reputation, and he became restive under the insinuations
of his rivals. Finally on coming to work one day he produced
a book from under his ragged coat as he entered the house, and said
proudly: “Look at that and now see if I don’t know something.” It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312">[pg 312]</a></span>
was a small day-book of about 240 pages, procured originally from
a white man, and was about half filled with writing in the Cherokee
characters. A brief examination disclosed the fact that it contained
just those matters that had proved so difficult to procure. Here
were prayers, songs, and prescriptions for the cure of all kinds of
diseases&mdash;for chills, rheumatism, frostbites, wounds, bad dreams,
and witchery; love charms, to gain the affections of a woman or
to cause her to hate a detested rival; fishing charms, hunting
charms&mdash;including the songs without which none could ever hope to
kill any game; prayers to make the corn grow, to frighten away
storms, and to drive off witches; prayers for long life, for safety
among strangers, for acquiring influence in council and success in
the ball play. There were prayers to the Long Man, the Ancient
White, the Great Whirlwind, the Yellow Rattlesnake, and to a hundred
other gods of the Cherokee pantheon. It was in fact an Indian
ritual and pharmacop&oelig;ia.</p>

<p>After recovering in a measure from the astonishment produced
by this discovery I inquired whether other shamans had such books.
“Yes,” said Swimmer, “we all have them.” Here then was a clew
to follow up. A bargain was made by which he was to have another
blank book into which to copy the formulas, after which the original
was bought. It is now deposited in the library of the Bureau
of Ethnology. The remainder of the time until the return was occupied
in getting an understanding of the contents of the book.</p>

<h3>THE GATIGWANASTI MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>Further inquiry elicited the names of several others who might
be supposed to have such papers. Before leaving a visit was paid to
one of these, a young man named Wilnoti, whose father, Gatigwanasti,
had been during his lifetime a prominent shaman, regarded as
a man of superior intelligence. Wilnoti, who is a professing Christian,
said that his father had had such papers, and after some explanation
from the chief he consented to show them. He produced
a box containing a lot of miscellaneous papers, testaments, and hymnbooks,
all in the Cherokee alphabet. Among them was his father’s
chief treasure, a manuscript book containing 122 pages of foolscap
size, completely filled with formulas of the same kind as those contained
in Swimmer’s book. There were also a large number of loose
sheets, making in all nearly 20&nbsp;0 foolscap pages of sacred formulas.</p>

<p>On offering to buy the papers, he replied that he wanted to keep
them in order to learn and practice these things himself&mdash;thus showing
how thin was the veneer of Christianity, in his case at least. On
representing to him that in a few years the new conditions would
render such knowledge valueless with the younger generation, and
that even if he retained the papers he would need some one else
to explain them to him, he again refused, saying that they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313">[pg 313]</a></span>
fall into the hands of Swimmer, who, he was determined, should
never see his father’s papers. Thus the negotiations came to an end
for the time.</p>

FACSIMILE OF SWIMMER MANUSCRIPT.<br>
Formula for Dalàni Ù<sup>n</sup>nagei (Page <a href="#page364">364</a>.)</div>

<p>On returning to the reservation in July, 1888, another effort was
made to get possession of the Gatigwanasti manuscripts and any
others of the same kind which could be procured. By this time the
Indians had had several months to talk over the matter, and the
idea had gradually dawned upon them that instead of taking their
knowledge away from them and locking it up in a box, the intention
was to preserve it to the world and pay them for it at the same
time. In addition the writer took every opportunity to impress
upon them the fact that he was acquainted with the secret knowledge
of other tribes and perhaps could give them as much as they
gave. It was now much easier to approach them, and on again visiting
Wilnoti, in company with the interpreter, who explained the
matter fully to him, he finally consented to lend the papers for a
time, with the same condition that neither Swimmer nor anyone
else but the chief and interpreter should see them, but he still refused
to sell them. However, this allowed the use of the papers, and
after repeated efforts during a period of several weeks, the matter
ended in the purchase of the papers outright, with unreserved permission
to show them for copying or explanation to anybody who
might be selected. Wilnoti was not of a mercenary disposition, and
after the first negotiations the chief difficulty was to overcome his
objection to parting with his father’s handwriting, but it was an
essential point to get the originals, and he was allowed to copy
some of the more important formulas, as he found it utterly out of
the question to copy the whole.</p>

<p>These papers of Gatigwanasti are the most valuable of the whole,
and amount to fully one-half the entire collection, about fifty pages
consisting of love charms. The formulas are beautifully written in
bold Cherokee characters, and the directions and headings are generally
explicit, bearing out the universal testimony that he was a
man of unusual intelligence and ability, characteristics inherited by
his son, who, although a young man and speaking no English, is
one of the most progressive and thoroughly reliable men of the band.</p>

<h3>THE GAHUNI MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>The next book procured was obtained from a woman named
Ayâsta, “The Spoiler,” and had been written by her husband, Gahuni,
who died about 30 years ago. The matter was not difficult to
arrange, as she had already been employed on several occasions, so
that she understood the purpose of the work, besides which her son
had been regularly engaged to copy and classify the manuscripts
already procured. The book was claimed as common property by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314">[pg 314]</a></span>
Ayâsta and her three sons, and negotiations had to be carried on
with each one, although in this instance the cash amount involved
was only half a dollar, in addition to another book into which to
copy some family records and personal memoranda. The book contains
only eight formulas, but these are of a character altogether
unique, the directions especially throwing a curious light on Indian
beliefs. There had been several other formulas of the class called
Y´û´<sup>n</sup>wĕhĭ, to cause hatred between man and wife, but these had been
torn out and destroyed by Ayâsta on the advice of an old shaman, in
order that her sons might never learn them. In referring to the
matter she spoke in a whisper, and it was evident enough that she
had full faith in the deadly power of these spells.</p>

<p>In addition to the formulas the book contains about twenty pages
of Scripture extracts in the same handwriting, for Gahuni, like several
others of their shamans, combined the professions of Indian conjurer
and Methodist preacher. After his death the book fell into
the hands of the younger members of the family, who filled it with
miscellaneous writings and scribblings. Among other things there
are about seventy pages of what was intended to be a Cherokee-English
pronouncing dictionary, probably written by the youngest
son, already mentioned, who has attended school, and who served
for some time as copyist on the formulas. This curious Indian production,
of which only a few columns are filled out, consists of a list
of simple English words and phrases, written in ordinary English
script, followed by Cherokee characters intended to give the approximate
pronunciation, together with the corresponding word in the
Cherokee language and characters. As the language lacks a number
of sounds which are of frequent occurrence in English, the attempts
to indicate the pronunciation sometimes give amusing results. Thus
we find: <i>Fox</i> (English script); <i>kwâgisĭ´</i> (Cherokee characters);
<i>tsú‘lû´</i>
(Cherokee characters). As the Cherokee language lacks the labial
<i>f</i> and has no compound sound equivalent to our <i>x</i>, <i>kwâgisĭ´</i> is as
near as the Cherokee speaker can come to pronouncing our word <i>fox</i>. In
the same way “bet” becomes <i>wĕtĭ</i>, and “sheep” is <i>síkwĭ</i>, while “if
he has no dog” appears in the disguise of <i>ikwĭ hâsĭ nâ dâ´ga</i>.</p>


<h3>THE INÂLI MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>In the course of further inquiries in regard to the whereabouts of
other manuscripts of this kind we heard a great deal about Inâ´lĭ, or
“Black Fox,” who had died a few years before at an advanced age,
and who was universally admitted to have been one of their most
able men and the most prominent literary character among them,
for from what has been said it must be sufficiently evident that the
Cherokees have their native literature and literary men. Like those
already mentioned, he was a full-blood Cherokee, speaking no English,
and in the course of a long lifetime he had filled almost every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315">[pg 315]</a></span>
position of honor among his people, including those of councilor,
keeper of the townhouse records, Sunday-school leader, conjurer,
officer in the Confederate service, and Methodist preacher, at last
dying, as he was born, in the ancient faith of his forefathers.</p>

FACSIMILE OF GATIGWANASTI MANUSCRIPT.<br>
Yugwilû´ formula. (Page <a href="#page375">375</a>.)
</div>

<p>On inquiring of his daughter she stated that her father had left a
great many papers, most of which were still in her possession, and
on receiving from the interpreter an explanation of our purpose she
readily gave permission to examine and make selections from them
on condition that the matter should be kept secret from outsiders.
A day was appointed for visiting her, and on arriving we found her
living in a comfortable log house, built by Inâlĭ himself, with her
children and an ancient female relative, a decrepit old woman with
snow-white hair and vacant countenance. This was the oldest woman
of the tribe, and though now so feeble and childish, she had been a
veritable savage in her young days, having carried a scalp in the
scalp dance in the Creek war 75 years before.</p>

<p>Having placed chairs for us in the shade Inâlĭ’s daughter brought
out a small box filled with papers of various kinds, both Cherokee
and English. The work of examining these was a tedious business,
as each paper had to be opened out and enough of it read to get the
general drift of the contents, after which the several classes were
arranged in separate piles. While in the midst of this work she
brought out another box nearly as large as a small trunk, and on
setting it down there was revealed to the astonished gaze such a
mass of material as it had not seemed possible could exist in the
entire tribe.</p>

<p>In addition to papers of the sort already mentioned there were a
number of letters in English from various officials and religious
organizations, and addressed to “Enola,” to “Rev. Black Fox,” and
to “Black Fox, Esq,” with a large number of war letters written to
him by Cherokees who had enlisted in the Confederate service.
These latter are all written in the Cherokee characters, in the usual
gossipy style common among friends, and several of them contain
important historic material in regard to the movements of the two
armies in East Tennessee. Among other things was found his certificate
as a Methodist preacher, dated in 1848. “Know all men by
these presents that Black Fox (Cherokee) is hereby authorized to
exercise his Gifts and Graces as a local preacher in M.&nbsp;E. Church South.”.</p>

<p>There was found a manuscript book in Inâlĭ’s handwriting containing
the records of the old council of Wolftown, of which he had
been secretary for several years down to the beginning of the war.
This also contains some valuable materials.</p>

<p>There were also a number of miscellaneous books, papers, and pictures,
together with various trinkets and a number of conjuring stones.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316">[pg 316]</a></span>

<p>In fact the box was a regular curiosity shop, and it was with a
feeling akin, to despair that we viewed the piles of manuscript which
had to be waded through and classified. There was a day’s hard
work ahead, and it was already past noon; but the woman was not
done yet, and after rummaging about inside the house for a while
longer she appeared with another armful of papers, which she emptied
on top of the others. This was the last straw; and finding it
impossible to examine in detail such a mass of material we contented
ourselves with picking out the sacred formulas and the two manuscript
books containing the town-house records and scriptural quotations
and departed.</p>

<p>The daughter of Black Fox agreed to fetch down the other papers
in a few days for further examination at our leisure; and she kept her
promise, bringing with her at the same time a number of additional
formulas which she had not been able to obtain before. A large
number of letters and other papers were selected from the miscellaneous
lot, and these, with the others obtained from her, are now
deposited also with the Bureau of Ethnology. Among other things
found at this house were several beads of the old shell wampum, of
whose use the Cherokees have now lost even the recollection. She
knew only that they were very old and different from the common
beads, but she prized them as talismans, and firmly refused to part with them.</p>

<h3>OTHER MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<p>Subsequently a few formulas were obtained from an old shaman
named Tsiskwa or “Bird,” but they were so carelessly written as to
be almost worthless, and the old man who wrote them, being then
on his dying bed, was unable to give much help in the matter. However,
as he was anxious to tell what he knew an attempt was made
to take down some formulas from his dictation. A few more were
obtained in this way but the results were not satisfactory and the
experiment was abandoned. About the same time A‘wani´ta or
“Young Deer,” one of their best herb doctors, was engaged to collect
the various plants used in medicine and describe their uses.
While thus employed he wrote in a book furnished him for the purpose
a number of formulas used by him in his practice, giving at
the same time a verbal explanation of the theory and ceremonies.
Among these was one for protection in battle, which had been used
by himself and a number of other Cherokees in the late war. Another
doctor named Takwati´hĭ or “Catawba Killer,” was afterward
employed on the same work and furnished some additional
formulas which he had had his son write down from his dictation,
he himself being unable to write. His knowledge was limited to
the practice of a few specialties, but in regard to these his information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317">[pg 317]</a></span>
was detailed and accurate. There was one for bleeding with
the cupping horn. All these formulas obtained from Tsiskwa,
A´wanita, and <ins class="correction" title="error for ‘Takwati´hi’ as above?">Takwtihi</ins> are now in possession of the Bureau.</p>

<h3>THE KANÂHETA ANI-TSALAGI ETI.</h3>

<p>Among the papers thus obtained was a large number which for
various reasons it was found difficult to handle or file for preservation.
Many of them had been written so long ago that the ink had
almost faded from the paper; others were written with lead pencil,
so that in handling them the characters soon became blurred and
almost illegible; a great many were written on scraps of paper of
all shapes and sizes; and others again were full of omissions and doublets,
due to the carelessness of the writer, while many consisted
simply of the prayer, with nothing in the nature of a heading or
prescription to show its purpose.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it was deemed expedient to have a number
of these formulas copied in more enduring form. For this purpose
it was decided to engage the services of Ayâsta’s youngest son,
an intelligent young man about nineteen years of age, who had attended
school long enough to obtain a fair acquaintance with English
in addition to his intimate knowledge of Cherokee. He was
also gifted with a ready comprehension, and from his mother and
uncle Tsiskwa had acquired some familiarity with many of the
archaic expressions used in the sacred formulas. He was commonly
known as “Will West,” but signed himself W.&nbsp;W. Long, Long
being the translation of his father’s name, Gûnahi´ta. After being
instructed as to how the work should be done with reference to paragraphing,
heading, etc., he was furnished a blank book of two hundred
pages into which to copy such formulas as it seemed desirable to
duplicate. He readily grasped the idea and in the course of about a
month, working always under the writer’s personal supervision, succeeded
in completely filling the book according to the plan outlined.
In addition to the duplicate formulas he wrote down a number of
dance and drinking songs, obtained originally from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>´inĭ, with
about thirty miscellaneous formulas obtained from various sources.
The book thus prepared is modeled on the plan of an ordinary book,
with headings, table of contents, and even with an illuminated title
page devised by the aid of the interpreter according to the regular
Cherokee idiomatic form, and is altogether a unique specimen of
Indian literary art. It contains in all two hundred and fifty-eight
formulas and songs, which of course are native aboriginal productions,
although the mechanical arrangement was performed under
the direction of a white man. This book also, under its Cherokee
title, <i>Kanâhe´ta Ani-Tsa´lagĭ E´tĭ</i> or “Ancient Cherokee Formulas,”
is now in the library of the Bureau.</p>

<p>There is still a considerable quantity of such manuscript in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318">[pg 318]</a></span>
hands of one or two shamans with whom there was no chance for
negotiating, but an effort will be made to obtain possession of these
on some future visit, should opportunity present. Those now in the
Bureau library comprised by far the greater portion of the whole
quantity held by the Indians, and as only a small portion of this was
copied by the owners it can not be duplicated by any future collector.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER OF THE FORMULAS&mdash;THE CHEROKEE RELIGION.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to overestimate the ethnologic importance of the
materials thus obtained. They are invaluable as the genuine production
of the Indian mind, setting forth in the clearest light the
state of the aboriginal religion before its contamination by contact
with the whites. To the psychologist and the student of myths they
are equally precious. In regard to their linguistic value we may
quote the language of Brinton, speaking of the sacred books of the
Mayas, already referred to:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Another value they have,... and it is one which will be properly appreciated
by any student of languages. They are, by common consent of all competent
authorities, the genuine productions of native minds, cast in the idiomatic
forms of the native tongue by those born to its use. No matter how fluent a
foreigner becomes in a language not his own, he can never use it as does one who
has been familiar with it from childhood. This general maxim is tenfold true when
we apply it to a European learning an American language. The flow of thought, as
exhibited in these two linguistic families, is in such different directions that no
amount of practice can render one equally accurate in both. Hence the importance
of studying a tongue as it is employed by natives; and hence the very high estimate
I place on these “Books of Chilan Balam” as linguistic material&mdash;an estimate much
increased by the great rarity of independent compositions in their own tongues by
members of the native races of this continent.<a class="tag" name="tag132" id="tag132" href="#note132">132</a> 
</p></blockquote>

<p>The same author, in speaking of the internal evidences of authenticity
contained in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Kichés,
uses the following words, which apply equally well to these Cherokee formulas:</p>

<blockquote><p>
To one familiar with native American myths, this one bears undeniable marks of
its aboriginal origin. Its frequent puerilities and inanities, its generally low and
coarse range of thought and expression, its occasional loftiness of both, its strange
metaphors and the prominence of strictly heathen names and potencies, bring it
into unmistakable relationship to the true native myth.<a class="tag" name="tag133" id="tag133" href="#note133">133</a> 
</p></blockquote>

<p>These formulas furnish a complete refutation of the assertion so
frequently made by ignorant and prejudiced writers that the Indian
had no religion excepting what they are pleased to call the meaning
less mummeries of the medicine man. This is the very reverse of
the truth. The Indian is essentially religious and contemplative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319">[pg 319]</a></span>
and it might almost be said that every act of his life is regulated
and determined by his religious belief. It matters not that some
may call this superstition. The difference is only relative. The
religion of to-day has developed from the cruder superstitions of
yesterday, and Christianity itself is but an outgrowth and enlargement
of the beliefs and ceremonies which have been preserved by
the Indian in their more ancient form. When we are willing to admit
that the Indian has a religion which he holds sacred, even though
it be different from our own, we can then admire the consistency of
the theory, the particularity of the ceremonial and the beauty of the
expression. So far from being a jumble of crudities, there is a wonderful
completeness about the whole system which is not surpassed
even by the ceremonial religions of the East. It is evident from a
study of these formulas that the Cherokee Indian was a polytheist
and that the spirit world was to him only a shadowy counterpart of
this. All his prayers were for temporal and tangible blessings&mdash;for
health, for long life, for success in the chase, in fishing, in war and
in love, for good crops, for protection and for revenge. He had no
Great Spirit, no happy hunting ground, no heaven, no hell, and
consequently death had for him no terrors and he awaited the inevitable
end with no anxiety as to the future. He was careful not
to violate the rights of his tribesman or to do injury to his feelings,
but there is nothing to show that he had any idea whatever of what
is called morality in the abstract.</p>

<p>As the medical formulas are first in number and importance it
may be well, for the better understanding of the theory involved, to
give the Cherokee account of</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF DISEASE AND MEDICINE.</h3>

<p>In the old days quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and insects could all
talk, and they and the human race lived together in peace and friendship.
But as time went on the people increased so rapidly that
their settlements spread over the whole earth and the poor animals
found themselves beginning to be cramped for room. This was bad
enough, but to add to their misfortunes man invented bows, knives,
blowguns, spears, and hooks, and began to slaughter the larger animals,
birds and fishes for the sake of their flesh or their skins, while
the smaller creatures, such as the frogs and worms, were crushed
and trodden upon without mercy, out of pure carelessness or contempt.
In this state of affairs the animals resolved to consult upon
measures for their common safety.</p>

<p>The bears were the first to meet in council in their townhouse in
Kuwa´hĭ, the “Mulberry Place,”<a class="tag" name="tag134" id="tag134" href="#note134">134</a>  and the old White Bear chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320">[pg 320]</a></span>
presided. After each in turn had made complaint against the way in
which man killed their friends, devoured their flesh and used their
skins for his own adornment, it was unanimously decided to begin
war at once against the human race. Some one asked what weapons
man used to accomplish their destruction. “Bows and arrows, of
course,” cried all the bears in chorus. “And what are they made
of?” was the next question. “The bow of wood and the string of
our own entrails,” replied one of the bears. It was then proposed
that they make a bow and some arrows and see if they could not
turn man’s weapons against himself. So one bear got a nice piece of
locust wood and another sacrificed himself for the good of the rest in
order to furnish a piece of his entrails for the string. But when
everything was ready and the first bear stepped up to make the
trial it was found that in letting the arrow fly after drawing back
the bow, his long claws caught the string and spoiled the shot. This
was annoying, but another suggested that he could overcome the
difficulty by cutting his claws, which was accordingly done, and on
a second trial it was found that the arrow went straight to the mark.
But here the chief, the old White Bear, interposed and said that it
was necessary that they should have long claws in order to be able
to climb trees. “One of us has already died to furnish the bowstring,
and if we now cut off our claws we shall all have to starve
together. It is better to trust to the teeth and claws which nature
has given us, for it is evident that man’s weapons were not intended for us.”</p>

<p>No one could suggest any better plan, so the old chief dismissed
the council and the bears dispersed to their forest haunts without
having concerted any means for preventing the increase of the human
race. Had the result of the council been otherwise, we should
now be at war with the bears, but as it is the hunter does not even
ask the bear’s pardon when he kills one.</p>

<p>The deer next held a council under their chief, the Little Deer,
and after some deliberation resolved to inflict rheumatism upon every
hunter who should kill one of their number, unless he took care to
ask their pardon for the offense. They sent notice of their decision
to the nearest settlement of Indians and told them at the same time
how to make propitiation when necessity forced them to kill one of
the deer tribe. Now, whenever the hunter brings down a deer, the
Little Deer, who is swift as the wind and can not be wounded, runs
quickly up to the spot and bending over the blood stains asks the
spirit of the deer if it has heard the prayer of the hunter for pardon.
If the reply be “Yes” all is well and the Little Deer goes on
his way, but if the reply be in the negative he follows on the trail
of the hunter, guided by the drops of blood on the ground, until he
arrives at the cabin in the settlement, when the Little Deer enters
invisibly and strikes the neglectful hunter with rheumatism, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321">[pg 321]</a></span>
he is rendered on the instant a helpless cripple. No hunter who has
regard for his health ever fails to ask pardon of the deer for killing
it, although some who have not learned the proper formula may attempt
to turn aside the Little Deer from his pursuit by building a
fire behind them in the trail.</p>

<p>Next came the fishes and reptiles, who had their own grievances
against humanity. They held a joint council and determined to
make their victims dream of snakes twining about them in slimy
folds and blowing their fetid breath in their faces, or to make them
dream of eating raw or decaying fish, so that they would lose appetite,
sicken, and die. Thus it is that snake and fish dreams are accounted for.</p>

<p>Finally the birds, insects, and smaller animals came together for
a like purpose, and the Grubworm presided over the deliberations.
It was decided that each in turn should express an opinion and then
vote on the question as to whether or not man should be deemed
guilty. Seven votes were to be sufficient to condemn him. One
after another denounced man’s cruelty and injustice toward the
other animals and voted in favor of his death. The Frog (walâ´sĭ)
spoke first and said: “We must do something to check the increase
of the race or people will become so numerous that we shall be
crowded from off the earth. See how man has kicked me about
because I’m ugly, as he says, until my back is covered with sores;”
and here he showed the spots on his skin. Next came the Bird
(tsi´skwa; no particular species is indicated), who condemned man
because “he burns my feet off,” alluding to the way in which the
hunter barbecues birds by impaling them on a stick set over the
fire, so that their feathers and tender feet are singed and burned.
Others followed in the same strain. The Ground Squirrel alone
ventured to say a word in behalf of man, who seldom hurt him
because he was so small; but this so enraged the others that they
fell upon the Ground Squirrel and tore him with their teeth and
claws, and the stripes remain on his back to this day.</p>

<p>The assembly then began to devise and name various diseases, one
after another, and had not their invention finally failed them not one
of the human race would have been able to survive. The Grubworm
in his place of honor hailed each new malady with delight,
until at last they had reached the end of the list, when some one
suggested that it be arranged so that menstruation should sometimes
prove fatal to woman. On this he rose up in his place and cried:
“Wata´<sup>n</sup> Thanks! I’m glad some of them will die, for they are
getting so thick that they tread on me.” He fairly shook with joy at
the thought, so that he fell over backward and could not get on his
feet again, but had to wriggle off on his back, as the Grubworm
has done ever since.</p>

<p>When the plants, who were friendly to man, heard what had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322">[pg 322]</a></span>
done by the animals, they determined to defeat their evil designs.
Each tree, shrub, and herb, down, even to the grasses and mosses,
agreed to furnish a remedy for some one of the diseases named, and
each said: “I shall appear to help man when he calls upon me in
his need.” Thus did medicine originate, and the plants, every one
of which has its use if we only knew it, furnish the antidote to counteract
the evil wrought by the revengeful animals. When the doctor
is in doubt what treatment to apply for the relief of a patient, the
spirit of the plant suggests to him the proper remedy.</p>

<h3>THEORY OF DISEASE&mdash;ANIMALS, GHOSTS, WITCHES.</h3>

<p>Such is the belief upon which their medical practice is based, and
whatever we may think of the theory it must be admitted that the
practice is consistent in all its details with the views set forth in the
myth. Like most primitive people the Cherokees believe that disease
and death are not natural, but are due to the evil influence of
animal spirits, ghosts, or witches. Haywood, writing in 1823, states
on the authority of two intelligent residents of the Cherokee nation:</p>

<blockquote><p>
In ancient times the Cherokees had no conception of anyone dying a natural
death. They universally ascribed the death of those who perished by disease to the
intervention or agency of evil spirits and witches and conjurers who had connection
with the Shina (Anisgi´na) or evil spirits.... A person dying by disease
and charging his death to have been procured by means of witchcraft or spirits,
by any other person, consigns that person to inevitable death. They profess to believe
that their conjurations have no effect upon white men.<a class="tag" name="tag135" id="tag135" href="#note135">135</a> 
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the authority of one of the same informants, he also mentions
the veneration which “their physicians have for the numbers four
and seven, who say that after man was placed upon the earth four
and seven nights were instituted for the cure of diseases in the human
body and the seventh night as the limit for female impurity.”<a class="tag" name="tag136" id="tag136" href="#note136">136</a> </p>

<p>Viewed from a scientific standpoint, their theory and diagnosis are
entirely wrong, and consequently we can hardly expect their therapeutic
system to be correct. As the learned Doctor Berendt states,
after an exhaustive study of the medical books of the Mayas, the
scientific value of their remedies is “next to nothing.” It must be
admitted that many of the plants used in their medical practice possess
real curative properties, but it is equally true that many others
held in as high estimation are inert. It seems probable that in the
beginning the various herbs and other plants were regarded as so
many fetiches and were selected from some fancied connection with
the disease animal, according to the idea known to modern folklorists
as the doctrine of signatures. Thus at the present day the
doctor puts into the decoction intended as a vermifuge some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323">[pg 323]</a></span>
red fleshy stalks of the common purslane or chickweed (Portulaca
oleracea), because these stalks somewhat resemble worms and consequently
must have some occult influence over worms. Here the
chickweed is a fetich precisely as is the flint arrow head which is put
into the same decoction, in order that in the same mysterious manner
its sharp cutting qualities may be communicated to the liquid
and enable it to cut the worms into pieces. In like manner, biliousness
is called by the Cherokees dalâ´nĭ or “yellow,” because the
most apparent symptom of the disease is the vomiting by the patient
of the yellow bile, and hence the doctor selects for the decoction four
different herbs, each of which is also called dalânĭ, because of the
color of the root, stalk, or flower. The same idea is carried out in
the tabu which generally accompanies the treatment. Thus a scrofulous
patient must abstain from eating the meat of a turkey, because
the fleshy dewlap which depends from its throat somewhat resembles
an inflamed scrofulous eruption. On killing a deer the hunter
always makes an incision in the hind quarter and removes the hamstring,
because this tendon, when severed, draws up into the flesh;
ergo, any one who should unfortunately partake of the hamstring
would find his limbs draw up in the same manner.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in course of time a haphazard use of
plants would naturally lead to the discovery that certain herbs are
efficacious in certain combinations of symptoms. These plants would
thus come into more frequent use and finally would obtain general
recognition in the Indian materia medica. By such a process of
evolution an empiric system of medicine has grown up among the
Cherokees, by which they are able to treat some classes of ailments
with some degree of success, although without any intelligent
idea of the process involved. It must be remembered that our own
medical system has its remote origin in the same mythic conception
of disease, and that within two hundred years judicial courts have
condemned women to be burned to death for producing sickness by
spells and incantations, while even at the present day our faith-cure
professors reap their richest harvest among people commonly
supposed to belong to the intelligent classes. In the treatment of
wounds the Cherokee doctors exhibit a considerable degree of skill,
but as far as any internal ailment is concerned the average farmer’s
wife is worth all the doctors in the whole tribe.</p>

<p>The faith of the patient has much to do with his recovery, for the
Indian has the same implicit confidence in the shaman that a child
has in a more intelligent physician. The ceremonies and prayers
are well calculated to inspire this feeling, and the effect thus produced
upon the mind of the sick man undoubtedly reacts favorably upon
his physical organization.</p>

<p>The following list of twenty plants used in Cherokee practice
will give a better idea of the extent of their medical knowledge than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324">[pg 324]</a></span>
could be conveyed by a lengthy dissertation. The names are given
in the order in which they occur in the botanic notebook filled on
the reservation, excluding names of food plants and species not identified,
so that no attempt has been made to select in accordance with
a preconceived theory. Following the name of each plant are given
its uses as described by the Indian doctors, together with its properties
as set forth in the United States Dispensatory, one of the leading
pharmacop&oelig;ias in use in this country.<a class="tag" name="tag137" id="tag137" href="#note137">137</a>  For the benefit of those not
versed in medical phraseology it may be stated that aperient, cathartic,
and deobstruent are terms applied to medicines intended to open
or purge the bowels, a diuretic has the property of exciting the flow
of urine, a diaphoretic excites perspiration, and a demulcent protects
or soothes irritated tissues, while hæmoptysis denotes a peculiar
variety of blood-spitting and aphthous is an adjective applied to
ulcerations in the mouth.</p>

<h3>SELECTED LIST OF PLANTS USED.</h3>

<div class="drama">
<p>1. UNASTE´TSTIYÛ=“very small root”&mdash;Aristolochia serpentaria&mdash;Virginia or black
snakeroot: Decoction of root blown upon patient for fever and feverish headache,
and drunk for coughs; root chewed and spit upon wound to cure snake
bites; bruised root placed in hollow tooth for toothache, and held against
nose made sore by constant blowing in colds. Dispensatory: “A stimulant
tonic, acting also as a diaphoretic or diuretic, according to the mode of its
application; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* also been highly recommended in intermittent fevers,
and though itself generally inadequate to the cure often proves serviceable
as an adjunct to Peruvian bark or sulphate of quinia.” Also used for typhous
diseases, in dyspepsia, as a gargle for sore throat, as a mild stimulant in
typhoid fevers, and to promote eruptions. The genus derives its scientific
name from its supposed efficacy in promoting menstrual discharge, and some
species have acquired the “reputation of antidotes for the bites of serpents.”</p>

<p>2. UNISTIL´Û<sup>n</sup>ISTÎ<a class="tag" name="tag138" id="tag138" href="#note138">138</a> =“they stick on”&mdash;Cynoglossum Morrisoni&mdash;Beggar lice: Decoction
of root or top drunk for kidney troubles; bruised root used with bear
oil as an ointment for cancer; forgetful persons drink a decoction of this
plant, and probably also of other similar bur plants, from an idea that the
sticking qualities of the burs will thus be imparted to the memory. From a
similar connection of ideas the root is also used in the preparation of love
charms. Dispensatory: Not named. C. officinale “has been used as a demulcent
and sedative in coughs, catarrh, spitting of blood, dysentery, and
diarrhea, and has been also applied externally in burns, ulcers, scrofulous
tumors and goiter.”</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325">[pg 325]</a></span>

<p>3. Û<sup>n</sup>NAGÉI=“black”&mdash;Cassia Marilandica&mdash;Wild senna: Root bruised and moistened
with water for poulticing sores; decoction drunk for fever and for a disease
also called û<sup>n</sup>nage´i, or “black” (same name as plant), in which the hands
and eye sockets are said to turn black; also for a disease described as similar
to û<sup>n</sup>nagei, but more dangerous, in which the eye sockets become black, while
black spots appear on the arms, legs, and over the ribs on one side of the
body, accompanied by partial paralysis, and resulting in death should the
black spots appear also on the other side. Dispensatory: Described as “an
efficient and safe cathartic, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* most conveniently given in the form
of infusion.”</p>

<p>4. KÂSD´ÚTA=“simulating ashes,” so called on account of the appearance of the
leaves&mdash;Gnaphalium decurrens&mdash;Life everlasting: Decoction drunk for colds;
also used in the sweat bath for various diseases and considered one of their
most valuable medical plants. Dispensatory: Not named. Decoctions of
two other species of this genus are mentioned as used by country people for
chest and bowel diseases, and for hemorrhages, bruises, ulcers, etc., although
“probably possessing little medicinal virtue.”</p>

<p>5. ALTSA´STI=“a wreath for the head”&mdash;Vicia Caroliniana&mdash;Vetch: Decoction
drunk for dyspepsia and pains in the back, and rubbed on stomach for cramp;
also rubbed on ball-players after scratching, to render their muscles tough,
and used in the same way after scratching in the disease referred to under
û<sup>n</sup>nagei, in which one side becomes black in spots, with partial paralysis;
also used in same manner in decoction with Kâsduta for rheumatism; considered
one of their most valuable medicinal herbs. Dispensatory: Not named.</p>

<p>6. DISTAI´YĬ=“they (the roots) are tough”&mdash;Tephrosia Virginiana&mdash;Catgut, Turkey
Pea, Goat’s Rue, or Devil’s Shoestrings: Decoction drunk for lassitude.
Women wash their hair in decoction of its roots to prevent its breaking or
falling out, because these roots are very tough and hard to break; from the
same idea ball-players rub the decoction on their limbs after scratching,
to toughen them. Dispensatory: Described as a cathartic with roots tonic
and aperient.</p>

<p>7. U´GA-ATASGI´SKĬ=“the pus oozes out”&mdash;Euphorbia hypericifolia&mdash;Milkweed:
Juice rubbed on for skin eruptions, especially on children’s heads; also used
as a purgative; decoction drunk for gonorrh&oelig;a and similar diseases in both
sexes, and held in high estimation for this purpose; juice used as an ointment
for sores and for sore nipples, and in connection with other herbs for cancer.
Dispensatory: The juice of all of the genus has the property of “powerfully
irritating the skin when applied to it,” while nearly all are powerful emetics
and cathartics. This species “has been highly commended as a remedy in
dysentery after due depletion, diarrhea, menorrhagia, and leucorrhea.”</p>

<p>8. GÛ´NĬGWALĬ´SKĬ=“It becomes discolored when bruised”&mdash;Scutellaria
lateriflora&mdash;Skullcap.
The name refers to the red juice which comes out of the stalk
when bruised or chewed. A decoction of the four varieties of Gûnigwalĭ´skĭ&mdash;S.
lateriflora, S. pilosa, Hypericum corymbosum, and Stylosanthes elatior&mdash;is
drunk to promote menstruation, and the same decoction is also drunk and
used as a wash to counteract the ill effects of eating food prepared by a woman
in the menstrual condition, or when such a woman by chance comes
into a sick room or a house under the tabu; also drunk for diarrhea and used
with other herbs in decoction for breast pains. Dispensatory: This plant
“produces no very obvious effects,” but some doctors regard it as possessed of
nervine, antispasmodic and tonic properties. None of the other three species are named.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326">[pg 326]</a></span>

<p>9. K´GA SKÛ<sup>n</sup>TAGĬ=“crow shin”&mdash;Adiantum pedatum&mdash;Maidenhair Fern: Used
either in decoction or poultice for rheumatism and chills, generally in
connection with some other fern. The doctors explain that the fronds of the
different varieties of fern are curled up in the young plant, but unroll and
straighten out as it grows, and consequently a decoction of ferns causes the
contracted muscles of the rheumatic patient to unbend and straighten out in
like manner. It is also used in decoction for fever. Dispensatory: The
leaves “have been supposed to be useful in chronic catarrh and other pectoral
affections.”</p>

<p>10. ANDA´NKALAGI´SKĬ=“it removes things from the gums”&mdash;Geranium maculatum&mdash;Wild
Alum, Cranesbill: Used in decoction with Yânû Unihye´stĭ (Vitis
cordifolia) to wash the mouths of children in thrush; also used alone for the
same purpose by blowing the chewed fiber into the mouth. Dispensatory:
“One of our best indigenous astringents. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Diarrhea, chronic dysentery,
cholora infantum in the latter stages, and the various hemorrhages are
the forms of disease in which it is most commonly used.” Also valuable as
“an application to indolent ulcers, an injection in gleet and leucorrhea, a
gargle in relaxation of the uvula and aphthous ulcerations of the throat.”
The other plant sometimes used with it is not mentioned.</p>

<p>11. Û´<sup>n</sup>LĔ UKĬ´LTĬ=“the locust frequents it”&mdash;Gillenia trifoliata&mdash;Indian Physic.
Two doctors state that it is good as a tea for bowel complaints, with fever
and yellow vomit; but another says that it is poisonous and that no decoction
is ever drunk, but that the beaten root is a good poultice for swellings.
Dispensatory: “Gillenia is a mild and efficient emetic, and like most substances
belonging to the same class occasionally acts upon the bowels. In very small
doses it has been thought to be tonic.”</p>

<p>12. SKWA´LĬ=Hepatica acutiloba&mdash;Liverwort, Heartleaf: Used for coughs either in
tea or by chewing root. Those who dream of snakes drink a decoction of
this herb and I´natû Ga´n‘ka=“snake tongue” (Camptosorus rhizophyllus or
Walking Fern) to produce vomiting, after which the dreams do not return.
The traders buy large quantities of liverwort from the Cherokees, who may
thus have learned to esteem it more highly than they otherwise would. The
appearance of the other plant, Camptosorus rhizophyllus, has evidently
determined its Cherokee name and the use to which it is applied. Dispensatory:
“Liverwort is a very mild demulcent tonic and astringent, supposed by some
to possess diuretic and deobstruent virtues. It was formerly used in Europe
in various complaints, especially chronic hepatic affections, but has fallen into
entire neglect. In this country, some years since, it acquired considerable
reputation, which, however, it has not maintained as a remedy in hæmoptysis
and chronic coughs.” The other plant is not named.</p>

<p>13. DA´YEWÛ=“it sews itself up,” because the leaves are said to grow together
again when torn&mdash;Cacalia atriplicifolia&mdash;Tassel Flower: Held in great repute
as a poultice for cuts, bruises, and cancer, to draw out the blood or poisonous
matter. The bruised leaf is bound over the spot and frequently removed.
The dry powdered leaf was formerly used to sprinkle over food like salt.
Dispensatory: Not named.</p>

<p>14. A´TALĬ KÛLĬ´=“it climbs the mountain.”&mdash;Aralia quinquefolia&mdash;Ginseng or
“Sang:” Decoction of root drunk for headache, cramps, etc., and for female
troubles; chewed root blown on spot for pains in the side. The Cherokees
sell large quantities of sang to the traders for 50 cents per pound, nearly
equivalent there to two days’ wages, a fact which has doubtless increased
their idea of its importance. Dispensatory: “The extraordinary medical
virtues formerly ascribed to ginseng had no other existence than in the
imagination of the Chinese. It is little more than a demulcent, and in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327">[pg 327]</a></span>
country is not employed as a medicine.” The Chinese name, ginseng, is
said to refer to the fancied resemblance of the root to a human figure, while in
the Cherokee formulas it is addressed as the “great man” or “little man,” and
this resemblance no doubt has much to do with the estimation in which it is
held by both peoples.</p>

<p>15. ÛTSATĬ UWADSĬSKA=“fish scales,” from shape of leaves&mdash;Thalictrum
anemonoides&mdash;Meadow Rue: Decoction of root drunk for diarrhea with vomiting.
Dispensatory: Not named.</p>

<p>16. K´KWĔ ULASU´LA=“partridge moccasin”&mdash;Cypripedium parviflorum&mdash;Lady-slipper:
Decoction of root used for worms in children. In the liquid are
placed some stalks of the common chickweed or purslane (Cerastium vulgatum)
which, from the appearance of its red fleshy stalks, is supposed to have
some connection with worms. Dispensatory: Described as “a gentle nervous
stimulant” useful in diseases in which the nerves are especially affected. The
other herb is not named.</p>

<p>17. A´HAWĬ´ AKĂ´TĂ´=“deer eye,” from the appearance of the flower&mdash;Rudbeckia
fulgida&mdash;Cone Flower: Decoction of root drunk for flux and for some private
diseases; also used as a wash for snake bites and swellings caused by (mythic)
tsgâya or worms; also dropped into weak or inflamed eyes. This last is probably
from the supposed connection between the eye and the flower resembling
the eye. Dispensatory: Not named.</p>

<p>18. UTĬSTUGĬ´=Polygonatum multiflorum latifolium&mdash;Solomon’s Seal: Root heated
and bruised and applied as a poultice to remove an ulcerating swelling called
tu´stĭ´, resembling a boil or carbuncle. Dispensatory: “This species acts
like
P. uniflorum, which is said to be emetic. In former times it was used
externally in bruises, especially those about the eyes, in tumors, wounds, and
cutaneous eruptions and was highly esteemed as a cosmetic. At present it
is not employed, though recommended by Hermann as a good remedy in
gout and rheumatism.” This species in decoction has been found to produce
“nausea, a cathartic effect and either diaphoresis or diuresis,” and is useful
“as an internal remedy in piles, and externally in the form of decoction,
in the affection of the skin resulting from the poisonous exhalations of
certain plants.”</p>

<p>19. ĂMĂDITA‘TÌ=“water dipper,” because water can be sucked up through its
hollow stalk&mdash;Eupatorium purpureum&mdash;Queen of the Meadow, Gravel Root:
Root used in decoction with a somewhat similar plant called Ămăditá´tĭ û´tanu,
or “large water dipper” (not identified) for difficult urination. Dispensatory:
“Said to operate as a diuretic. Its vulgar name of gravel root indicates
the popular estimation of its virtues.” The genus is described as tonic,
diaphoretic, and in large doses emetic and aperient.</p>

<p>20. YÂNA UTSĔSTA=“the bear lies on it”&mdash;Aspidium acrostichoides&mdash;Shield Fern:
Root decoction drunk to produce vomiting, and also used to rub on the skin,
after scratching, for rheumatism&mdash;in both cases some other plant is added to
the decoction; the warm decoction is also held in the mouth to relieve toothache.
Dispensatory: Not named.</p>
</div>

<p>The results obtained from a careful study of this list may be
summarized as follows: Of the twenty plants described as used by the
Cherokees, seven (Nos. 2, 4, 5, 13, 15, 17, and 20) are not noticed in
the Dispensatory even in the list of plants sometimes used although
regarded as not officinal. It is possible that one or two of these
seven plants have medical properties, but this can hardly be true of
a larger number unless we are disposed to believe that the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328">[pg 328]</a></span>
are better informed in this regard than the best educated white
physicians in the country. Two of these seven plants, however (Nos. 2
and 4), belong to genera which seem to have some of the properties
ascribed by the Indians to the species. Five others of the list (Nos.
8, 9, 11, 14, and 16) are used for entirely wrong purposes, taking the
Dispensatory as authority, and three of these are evidently used on
account of some fancied connection between the plant and the disease,
according to the doctrine of signatures. Three of the remainder
(Nos. 1, 3, and 6) may be classed as uncertain in their properties,
that is, while the plants themselves seem to possess some medical
value, the Indian mode of application is so far at variance with
recognized methods, or their own statements are so vague and conflicting,
that it is doubtful whether any good can result from the use
of the herbs. Thus the Unaste´tstiyû, or Virginia Snakeroot, is stated
by the Dispensatory to have several uses, and among other things is
said to have been highly recommended in intermittent fevers,
although alone it is “generally inadequate to the cure.” Though
not expressly stated, the natural inference is that it must be applied
internally, but the Cherokee doctor, while he also uses it for fever,
takes the decoction in his mouth and blows it over the head and
shoulders of the patient. Another of these, the Distai´yĭ, or Turkey
Pea, is described in the Dispensatory as having roots tonic and
aperient. The Cherokees drink a decoction of the roots for a feeling
of weakness and languor, from which it might be supposed that they
understood the tonic properties of the plant had not the same decoction
been used by the women as a hair wash, and by the ball players
to bathe their limbs, under the impression that the toughness of the
roots would thus be communicated to the hair or muscles. From
this fact and from the name of the plant, which means at once hard,
tough, or strong, it is quite probable that its roots are believed to
give strength to the patient solely because they themselves are so
strong and not because they have been proved to be really efficacious.
The remaining five plants have generally pronounced medicinal
qualities, and are used by the Cherokees for the very purposes for
which, according to the Dispensatory, they are best adapted; so that
we must admit that so much of their practice is correct, however
false the reasoning by which they have arrived at this result.</p>

<h3>MEDICAL PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>Taking the Dispensatory as the standard, and assuming that this
list is a fair epitome of what the Cherokees know concerning the
medical properties of plants, we find that five plants, or 25 per cent
of the whole number, are correctly used; twelve, or 60 per cent, are
presumably either worthless or incorrectly used, and three plants,
or 15 per cent, are so used that it is difficult to say whether they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329">[pg 329]</a></span>
of any benefit or not. Granting that two of these three produce
good results as used by the Indians, we should have 35 per cent, or
about one-third of the whole, as the proportion actually possessing
medical virtues, while the remaining two-thirds are inert, if not
positively injurious. It is not probable that a larger number of examples
would change the proportion to any appreciable extent. A
number of herbs used in connection with these principal plants may
probably be set down as worthless, inasmuch as they are not named
in the Dispensatory.</p>

<p>The results here arrived at will doubtless be a surprise to those
persons who hold that an Indian must necessarily be a good doctor,
and that the medicine man or conjurer, with his theories of ghosts,
witches, and revengeful animals, knows more about the properties
of plants and the cure of disease than does the trained botanist or
physician who has devoted a lifetime of study to the patient investigation
of his specialty, with all the accumulated information contained
in the works of his predecessors to build upon, and with all
the light thrown upon his pathway by the discoveries of modern
science. It is absurd to suppose that the savage, a child in intellect,
has reached a higher development in any branch of science than has
been attained by the civilized man, the product of long ages of intellectual
growth. It would be as unreasonable to suppose that the
Indian could be entirely ignorant of the medicinal properties of
plants, living as he did in the open air in close communion with
nature; but neither in accuracy nor extent can his knowledge be
compared for a moment with that of the trained student working
upon scientific principles.</p>

<p>Cherokee medicine is an empiric development of the fetich idea.
For a disease caused by the rabbit the antidote must be a plant
called “rabbit’s food,” “rabbit’s ear,” or “rabbit’s tail;” for snake
dreams the plant used is “snake’s tooth;” for worms a plant resembling
a worm in appearance, and for inflamed eyes a flower having
the appearance and name of “deer’s eye.” A yellow root must
be good when the patient vomits yellow bile, and a black one when
dark circles come about his eyes, and in each case the disease and
the plant alike are named from the color. A decoction of burs must
be a cure for forgetfulness, for there is nothing else that will stick
like a bur; and a decoction of the wiry roots of the “devil’s shoestrings”
must be an efficacious wash to toughen the ballplayer’s
muscles, for they are almost strong enough to stop the plowshare in
the furrow. It must be evident that under such a system the failures
must far outnumber the cures, yet it is not so long since half
our own medical practice was based upon the same idea of correspondences,
for the mediæval physicians taught that <i>similia similibus
curantur</i>, and have we not all heard that “the hair of the dog will
cure the bite?”</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330">[pg 330]</a></span>

<p>Their ignorance of the true medical principles involved is shown
by the regulations prescribed for the patient. With the exception
of the fasting, no sanitary precautions are taken to aid in the recovery
of the sick man or to contribute to his comfort. Even the
fasting is as much religious as sanative, for in most cases where it
is prescribed the doctor also must abstain from food until sunset,
just as in the Catholic church both priest and communicants remain
fasting from midnight until after the celebration of the divine mysteries.
As the Indian cuisine is extremely limited, no delicate or
appetizing dishes are prepared for the patient, who partakes of the
same heavy, sodden cornmeal dumplings and bean bread which form
his principal food in health. In most cases certain kinds of food are
prohibited, such as squirrel meat, fish, turkey, etc.; but the reason
is not that such food is considered deleterious to health, as we understand
it, but because of some fanciful connection with the disease
spirit. Thus if squirrels have caused the illness the patient must not
eat squirrel meat. If the disease be rheumatism, he must not eat the
leg of any animal, because the limbs are generally the seat of this
malady. Lye, salt, and hot food are always forbidden when there is
any prohibition at all; but here again, in nine cases out of ten, the regulation,
instead of being beneficial, serves only to add to his discomfort.
Lye enters into almost all the food preparations of the Cherokees,
the alkaline potash taking the place of salt, which is seldom
used among them, having been introduced by the whites. Their
bean and chestnut bread, cornmeal dumplings, hominy, and gruel
are all boiled in a pot, all contain lye, and are all, excepting the last,
served up hot from the fire. When cold their bread is about as hard
and tasteless as a lump of yesterday’s dough, and to condemn a sick
man to a diet of such dyspeptic food, eaten cold without even a pinch
of salt to give it a relish, would seem to be sufficient to kill him without
any further aid from the doctor. The salt or lye so strictly prohibited
is really a tonic and appetizer, and in many diseases acts with
curative effect. So much for the health regimen.</p>

<p>In serious cases the patient is secluded and no strangers are allowed
to enter the house. On first thought this would appear to be a genuine
sanitary precaution for the purpose of securing rest and quiet to
the sick man. Such, however, is not the case. The necessity for
quiet has probably never occurred to the Cherokee doctor, and this
regulation is intended simply to prevent any direct or indirect contact
with a woman in a pregnant or menstrual condition. Among
all primitive nations, including the ancient Hebrews, we find an
elaborate code of rules in regard to the conduct and treatment of
women on arriving at the age of puberty, during pregnancy and the
menstrual periods, and at childbirth. Among the Cherokees the
presence of a woman under any of these conditions, or even the presence
of any one who has come from a house where such a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331">[pg 331]</a></span>
resides, is considered to neutralize all the effects of the doctor’s treatment.
For this reason all women, excepting those of the household,
are excluded. A man is forbidden to enter, because he may have had
intercourse with a tabued woman, or may have come in contact with
her in some other way; and children also are shut out, because they
may have come from a cabin where dwells a woman subject to exclusion.
What is supposed to be the effect of the presence of a menstrual
woman in the family of the patient is not clear; but judging from
analogous customs in other tribes and from rules still enforced among
the Cherokees, notwithstanding their long contact with the whites,
it seems probable that in former times the patient was removed to a
smaller house or temporary bark lodge built for his accommodation
whenever the tabu as to women was prescribed by the doctor. Some
of the old men assert that in former times sick persons were removed
to the public townhouse, where they remained under the care of the
doctors until they either recovered or died. A curious instance of
this prohibition is given in the second Didû<sup>n</sup>lĕ´skĭ (rheumatism) formula
from the Gahuni manuscript (see page <a href="#page350">350</a>), where the patient
is required to abstain from touching a squirrel, a dog, a cat, a mountain
trout, or a woman, and must also have a chair appropriated to
his use alone during the four days that he is under treatment.</p>

<p>In cases of the children’s disease known as Gû<sup>n</sup>wani´gista´ĭ (see
formulas) it is forbidden to carry the child outdoors, but this is not
to procure rest for the little one, or to guard against exposure to cold
air, but because the birds send this disease, and should a bird chance
to be flying by overhead at the moment the napping of its wings
would <i>fan the disease back</i> into the body of the patient.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATION OF THE TABU.</h3>

<p>On a second visit to the reservation the writer once had a practical
illustration of the gaktû´<sup>n</sup>ta or tabu, which may be of interest as
showing how little sanitary ideas have to do with these precautions.
Having received several urgent invitations from Tsiskwa (Bird), an
old shaman of considerable repute, who was anxious to talk, but
confined to his bed by sickness, it was determined to visit him at his
house, several miles distant. On arriving we found another doctor
named Sû´<sup>n</sup>kĭ (The Mink) in charge of the patient and were told
that he had just that morning begun a four days’ gaktû´<sup>n</sup>ta which,
among other provisions, excluded all visitors. It was of no use to
argue that we had come by the express request of Tsiskwa. The
laws of the gaktû´<sup>n</sup>ta were as immutable as those of the Medes and
Persians, and neither doctor nor patient could hope for favorable
results from the treatment unless the regulations were enforced to
the letter. But although we might not enter the house, there was
no reason why we should not talk to the old man, so seats were
placed for us outside the door, while Tsiskwa lay stretched out on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332">[pg 332]</a></span>
the bed just inside and The Mink perched himself on the fence a few
yards distant to keep an eye on the proceedings. As there was a
possibility that a white man might unconsciously affect the operation
of the Indian medicine, the writer deemed it advisable to keep
out of sight altogether, and accordingly took up a position just
around the corner of the house, but within easy hearing distance,
while the interpreter sat facing the doorway within a few feet of the
sick man inside. Then began an animated conversation, Tsiskwa
inquiring, through the interpreter, as to the purpose of the Government
in gathering such information, wanting to know how we had
succeeded with other shamans and asking various questions in regard
to other tribes and their customs. The replies were given in the
same manner, an attempt being also made to draw him out as to the
extent of his own knowledge. Thus we talked until the old man grew
weary, but throughout the whole of this singular interview neither
party saw the other, nor was the gaktû´<sup>n</sup>ta violated by entering the
house. From this example it must be sufficiently evident that the
tabu as to visitors is not a hygienic precaution for securing greater
quiet to the patient, or to prevent the spread of contagion, but that
it is simply a religious observance of the tribe, exactly parallel to
many of the regulations among the ancient Jews, as laid down in
the book of Leviticus.</p>

<h3>NEGLECT OF SANITARY REGULATIONS.</h3>

<p>No rules are ever formulated as to fresh air or exercise, for the
sufficient reason that the door of the Cherokee log cabin is always
open, excepting at night and on the coldest days in winter, while the
Indian is seldom in the house during his waking hours unless when
necessity compels him. As most of their cabins are still built in the
old Indian style, without windows, the open door furnishes the only
means by which light is admitted to the interior, although when
closed the fire on the hearth helps to make amends for the deficiency.
On the other hand, no precautions are taken to guard against cold,
dampness, or sudden drafts. During the greater part of the year
whole families sleep outside upon the ground, rolled up in an old
blanket. The Cherokee is careless of exposure and utterly indifferent
to the simplest rules of hygiene. He will walk all day in a pouring
rain clad only in a thin shirt and a pair of pants. He goes barefoot
and frequently bareheaded nearly the entire year, and even on
a frosty morning in late November, when the streams are of almost
icy coldness, men and women will deliberately ford the river where
the water is waist deep in preference to going a few hundred
yards to a foot-log. At their dances in the open air men, women,
and children, with bare feet and thinly clad, dance upon the damp
ground from darkness until daylight, sometimes enveloped in a thick
mountain fog which makes even the neighboring treetops invisible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333">[pg 333]</a></span>
while the mothers have their infants laid away under the bushes
with only a shawl between them and the cold ground. In their ball
plays also each young man, before going into the game, is subjected
to an ordeal of dancing, bleeding, and cold plunge baths, without
food or sleep, which must unquestionably waste his physical energy.</p>

<p>In the old days when the Cherokee was the lord of the whole country
from the Savannah to the Ohio, well fed and warmly clad and
leading an active life in the open air, he was able to maintain a condition
of robust health notwithstanding the incorrectness of his
medical ideas and his general disregard of sanitary regulations.
But with the advent of the white man and the destruction of the
game all this was changed. The East Cherokee of to-day is a dejected
being; poorly fed, and worse clothed, rarely tasting meat, cut
off from the old free life, and with no incentive to a better, and constantly
bowed down by a sense of helpless degradation in the presence
of his conqueror. Considering all the circumstances, it may
seem a matter of surprise that any of them are still in existence.
As a matter of fact, the best information that could be obtained in
the absence of any official statistics indicated a slow but steady
decrease during the last five years. Only the constitutional vigor,
inherited from their warrior ancestors, has enabled them to sustain
the shock of the changed conditions of the last half century. The
uniform good health of the children in the training school shows
that the case is not hopeless, however, and that under favorable conditions,
with a proper food supply and a regular mode of living, the
Cherokee can hold his own with the white man.</p>

<h3>THE SWEAT BATH&mdash;BLEEDING&mdash;RUBBING&mdash;BATHING.</h3>

<p>In addition to their herb treatment the Cherokees frequently resort to
sweat baths, bleeding, rubbing, and cold baths in the running stream,
to say nothing of the beads and other conjuring paraphernalia generally
used in connection with the ceremony. The sweat bath was
in common use among almost all the tribes north of Mexico excepting
the central and eastern Eskimo, and was considered the great
cure-all in sickness and invigorant in health. Among many tribes
it appears to have been regarded as a ceremonial observance, but the
Cherokees seem to have looked upon it simply as a medical application,
while the ceremonial part was confined to the use of the plunge
bath. The person wishing to make trial of the virtues of the sweat
bath entered the â´sĭ, a small earth-covered log house only high
enough to allow of sitting down. After divesting himself of his
clothing, some large bowlders, previously heated in a fire, were
placed near him, and over them was poured a decoction of the beaten
roots of the wild parsnip. The door was closed so that no air could
enter from the outside, and the patient sat in the sweltering steam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334">[pg 334]</a></span>
until he was in a profuse perspiration and nearly choked by the
pungent fumes of the decoction. In accordance with general Indian
practice it may be that he plunged into the river before resuming
his clothing; but in modern times this part of the operation is omitted
and the patient is drenched with cold water instead. Since the
âsĭ has gone out of general use the sweating takes place in the ordinary
dwelling, the steam being confined under a blanket wrapped
around the patient. During the prevalence of the smallpox epidemic
among the Cherokees at the close of the late war the sweat
bath was universally called into requisition to stay the progress of
the disease, and as the result about three hundred of the band died,
while many of the survivors will carry the marks of the visitation
to the grave. The sweat bath, with the accompanying cold water
application, being regarded as the great panacea, seems to have been
resorted to by the Indians in all parts of the country whenever visited
by smallpox&mdash;originally introduced by the whites&mdash;and in consequence
of this mistaken treatment they have died, in the language
of an old writer, “like rotten sheep” and at times whole tribes have
been almost swept away. Many of the Cherokees tried to ward
off the disease by eating the flesh of the buzzard, which they believe
to enjoy entire immunity from sickness, owing to its foul smell,
which keeps the disease spirits at a distance.</p>

<p>Bleeding is resorted to in a number of cases, especially in rheumatism
and in preparing for the ball play. There are two methods of
performing the operation, bleeding proper and scratching, the latter
being preparatory to rubbing on the medicine, which is thus brought
into more direct contact with the blood. The bleeding is performed
with a small cupping horn, to which suction is applied in the ordinary
manner, after scarification with a flint or piece of broken
glass. In the blood thus drawn out the shaman claims sometimes
to find a minute pebble, a sharpened stick or something of the kind,
which he asserts to be the cause of the trouble and to have been conveyed
into the body of the patient through the evil spells of an
enemy. He frequently pretends to suck out such an object by the
application of the lips alone, without any scarification whatever.
Scratching is a painful process and is performed with a brier, a flint
arrowhead, a rattlesnake’s tooth, or even with a piece of glass,
according to the nature of the ailment, while in preparing the young
men for the ball play the shaman uses an instrument somewhat
resembling a comb, having seven teeth made from the sharpened
splinters of the leg bone of a turkey. The scratching is usually
done according to a particular pattern, the regular method for the
ball play being to draw the scratcher four times down the upper
part of each arm, thus making twenty-eight scratches each about 6
inches in length, repeating the operation on each arm below the
elbow and on each leg above and below the knee. Finally, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335">[pg 335]</a></span>
instrument is drawn across the breast from the two shoulders so as
to form a cross; another curving stroke is made to connect the two
upper ends of the cross, and the same pattern is repeated on the
back, so that the body is thus gashed in nearly three hundred places.
Although very painful for a while, as may well be supposed, the
scratches do not penetrate deep enough to result seriously, excepting
in some cases where erysipelas sets in. While the blood is still
flowing freely the medicine, which in this case is intended to toughen,
the muscles of the player, is rubbed into the wounds after which
the sufferer plunges into the stream and washes off the blood. In
order that the blood may flow the longer without clotting it is
frequently scraped off with a small switch as it flows. In rheumatism
and other local diseases the scratching is confined to the part
affected. The instrument used is selected in accordance with the
mythologic theory, excepting in the case of the piece of glass, which
is merely a modern makeshift for the flint arrowhead.</p>

<p>Rubbing, used commonly for pains and swellings of the abdomen,
is a very simple operation performed with the tip of the finger or
the palm of the hand, and can not be dignified with the name of
massage. In one of the Gahuni formulas for treating snake bites
(page <a href="#page351">351</a>) the operator is told to rub in a direction contrary to that
in which the snake coils itself, because “this is just the same as
uncoiling it.” Blowing upon the part affected, as well as upon the
head, hands, and other parts of the body, is also an important
feature of the ceremonial performance. In one of the formulas it
is specified that the doctor must blow first upon the right hand of
the patient, then upon the left foot, then upon the left hand, and
finally upon the right foot, thus making an imaginary cross.</p>

<p>Bathing in the running stream, or “going to water,” as it is called,
is one of their most frequent medico-religious ceremonies, and is
performed on a great variety of occasions, such as at each new
moon, before eating the new food at the green corn dance, before
the medicine dance and other ceremonial dances before and after
the ball play, in connection with the prayers for long life, to counteract
the effects of bad dreams or the evil spells of an enemy,
and as a part of the regular treatment in various diseases. The
details of the ceremony are very elaborate and vary according to
the purpose for which it is performed, but in all cases both shaman
and client are fasting from the previous evening, the ceremony being
generally performed just at daybreak. The bather usually dips
completely under the water four or seven times, but in some cases
it is sufficient to pour the water from the hand upon the head and
breast. In the ball play the ball sticks are dipped into the water at
the same time. While the bather is in the water the shaman is
going through with his part of the performance on the bank and
draws omens from the motion of the beads between his thumb and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336">[pg 336]</a></span>
finger, or of the fishes in the water. Although the old customs are
fast dying out this ceremony is never neglected at the ball play,
and is also strictly observed by many families on occasion of eating
the new corn, at each new moon, and on other special occasions,
even when it is necessary to break the ice in the stream for the
purpose, and to the neglect of this rite the older people attribute
many of the evils which have come upon the tribe in later days.
The latter part of autumn is deemed the most suitable season of
the year for this ceremony, as the leaves which then cover the
surface of the stream are supposed to impart their medicinal virtues
to the water.</p>

<h3>SHAMANS AND WHITE PHYSICIANS.</h3>

<p>Of late years, especially since the establishment of schools among
them, the Cherokees are gradually beginning to lose confidence in
the abilities of their own doctors and are becoming more disposed
to accept treatment from white physicians. The shamans are
naturally jealous of this infringement upon their authority and
endeavor to prevent the spread of the heresy by asserting the convenient
doctrine that the white man’s medicine is inevitably fatal to
an Indian unless eradicated from the system by a continuous course
of treatment for four years under the hands of a skillful shaman.
The officers of the training school established by the Government a
few years ago met with considerable difficulty on this account for
some time, as the parents insisted on removing the children at the
first appearance of illness in order that they might be treated by the
shamans, until convinced by experience that the children received
better attention at the school than could possibly be had in their
own homes. In one instance, where a woman was attacked by a
pulmonary complaint akin to consumption, her husband, a man of
rather more than the usual amount of intelligence, was persuaded to
call in the services of a competent white physician, who diagnosed
the case and left a prescription. On a second visit, a few days later,
he found that the family, dreading the consequences of this departure
from old customs, had employed a shaman, who asserted that
the trouble was caused by a sharpened stick which some enemy had
caused to be imbedded in the woman’s side. He accordingly began
a series of conjurations for the removal of the stick, while the white
physician and his medicine were disregarded, and in due time the
woman died. Two children soon followed her to the grave, from the
contagion or the inherited seeds of the same disease, but here also
the sharpened sticks were held responsible, and, notwithstanding the
three deaths under such treatment, the husband and father, who was
at one time a preacher, still has faith in the assertions of the shaman.
The appointment of a competent physician to look after the health
of the Indians would go far to eradicate these false ideas and prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337">[pg 337]</a></span>
much sickness and suffering; but, as the Government has made no
such provision, the Indians, both on and off the reservation, excepting
the children in the home school, are entirely without medical care.</p>

<h3>MEDICINE DANCES.</h3>

<p>The Cherokees have a dance known as the Medicine Dance, which
is generally performed in connection with other dances when a number
of people assemble for a night of enjoyment. It possesses no
features of special interest and differs in no essential respect from a
dozen other of the lesser dances. Besides this, however, there was
another, known as the Medicine Boiling Dance, which, for importance
and solemn ceremonial, was second only to the great Green Corn
Dance. It has now been discontinued on the reservation for about
twenty years. It took place in the fall, probably preceding the Green
Corn Dance, and continued four days. The principal ceremony in
connection with it was the drinking of a strong decoction of various
herbs, which acted as a violent emetic and purgative. The usual
fasting and going to water accompanied the dancing and medicine-drinking.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS.</h3>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to obtain from the doctors any accurate
statement of the nature of a malady, owing to the fact that their
description of the symptoms is always of the vaguest character, while
in general the name given to the disease by the shaman expresses
only his opinion as to the occult cause of the trouble. Thus they
have definite names for rheumatism, toothache, boils, and a few other
ailments of like positive character, but beyond this their description
of symptoms generally resolves itself into a statement that
the patient has bad dreams, looks black around the eyes, or feels
tired, while the disease is assigned such names as “when they dream
of snakes,” “when they dream of fish,” “when ghosts trouble them,”
“when something is making something else eat them,” or “when
the food is changed,” i.e., when a witch causes it to sprout and grow
in the body of the patient or transforms it into a lizard, frog, or
sharpened stick.</p>

<h3>THE PAY OF THE SHAMAN.</h3>

<p>The consideration which the doctor receives for his services is
called ugista´‘tĭ, a word of doubtful etymology, but probably derived
from the verb tsĭ´giû, “I take” or “I eat.” In former times this was
generally a deer-skin or a pair of moccasins, but is now a certain
quantity of cloth, a garment, or a handkerchief. The shamans disclaim
the idea that the ugistâ´‘tĭ is pay, in our sense of the word, but
assert that it is one of the agencies in the removal and banishment
of the disease spirit. Their explanation is somewhat obscure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338">[pg 338]</a></span>
the cloth seems to be intended either as an offering to the disease
spirit, as a ransom to procure the release of his intended victim, or
as a covering to protect the hand of a shaman while engaged in pulling
the disease from the body of the patient. The first theory, which
includes also the idea of vicarious atonement, is common to many
primitive peoples. Whichever may be the true explanation, the evil
influence of the disease is believed to enter into the cloth, which
must therefore be sold or given away by the doctor, as otherwise it will
cause his death when the pile thus accumulating reaches the height
of his head. No evil results seem to follow its transfer from the
shaman to a third party. The doctor can not bestow anything thus
received upon a member of his own family unless that individual
gives him something in return. If the consideration thus received,
however, be anything eatable, the doctor may partake along with the
rest of the family. As a general rule the doctor makes no charge
for his services, and the consideration is regarded as a free-will offering.
This remark applies only to the medical practice, as the shaman
always demands and receives a fixed remuneration for performing
love charms, hunting ceremonials, and other conjurations of a miscellaneous
character. Moreover, whenever the beads are used the
patient must furnish a certain quantity of new cloth upon which to
place them, and at the close of the ceremony the doctor rolls up the
cloth, beads and all, and takes them away with him. The cloth thus
received by the doctor for working with the beads must not be used
by him, but must be sold. In one instance a doctor kept a handkerchief
which he received for his services, but instead sold a better one
of his own. Additional cloth is thus given each time the ceremony is
repeated, each time a second four days’ course of treatment is begun,
and as often as the doctor sees fit to change his method of procedure.
Thus, when he begins to treat a sick man for a disease caused by rabbits,
he expects to receive a certain ugista´‘tĭ; but, should he decide
after a time that the terrapin or the red bird is responsible for the
trouble, he adopts a different course of treatment, for which another
ugista´‘tĭ is necessary. Should the sickness not yield readily to his
efforts, it is because the disease animal requires a greater ugista´‘tĭ, and
the quantity of cloth must be doubled, so that on the whole the doctrine
is a very convenient one for the shaman. In many of the formulas
explicit directions are given as to the pay which the shaman is to
receive for performing the ceremony. In one of the Gatigwanasti
formulas, after specifying the amount of cloth to be paid, the writer
of it makes the additional proviso that it must be “pretty good cloth,
too,” asserting as a clincher that “this is what the old folks said a
long time ago.”</p>

<p>The ugista´‘tĭ can not be paid by either one of a married couple to
the other, and, as it is considered a necessary accompaniment of the
application, it follows that a shaman can not treat his own wife in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339">[pg 339]</a></span>
sickness, and vice versa. Neither can the husband or wife of the
sick person send for the doctor, but the call must come from some
one of the blood relatives of the patient. In one instance within the
writer’s knowledge a woman complained that her husband was very
sick and needed a doctor’s attention, but his relatives were taking
no steps in the matter and it was not permissible for her to do so.</p>

<h3>CEREMONIES FOR GATHERING PLANTS AND PREPARING MEDICINE.</h3>

<p>There are a number of ceremonies and regulations observed in
connection with the gathering of the herbs, roots, and barks, which
can not be given in detail within the limits of this paper. In searching
for his medicinal plants the shaman goes provided with a number
of white and red beads, and approaches the plant from a certain
direction, going round it from right to left one or four times, reciting
certain prayers the while. He then pulls up the plant by the
roots and drops one of the beads into the hole and covers it up with
the loose earth. In one of the formulas for hunting ginseng the
hunter addresses the mountain as the “Great Man” and assures it
that he comes only to take a small piece of flesh (the ginseng) from
its side, so that it seems probable that the bead is intended as a compensation
to the earth for the plant thus torn from her bosom. In some
cases the doctor must pass by the first three plants met until he comes
to the fourth, which he takes and may then return for the others. The
bark is always taken from the east side of the tree, and when the
root or branch is used it must also be one which runs out toward
the east, the reason given being that these have imbibed more medical
potency from the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>When the roots, herbs, and barks which enter into the prescription
have been thus gathered the doctor ties them up into a convenient
package, which he takes to a running stream and casts into the water
with appropriate prayers. Should the package float, as it generally
does, he accepts the fact as an omen that his treatment will be successful.
On the other hand, should it sink, he concludes that some
part of the preceding ceremony has been improperly carried out
and at once sets about procuring a new package, going over the
whole performance from the beginning. Herb-gathering by moonlight,
so important a feature in European folk medicine, seems to
be no part of Cherokee ceremonial. There are fixed regulations in
regard to the preparing of the decoction, the care of the medicine
during the continuance of the treatment, and the disposal of what
remains after the treatment is at an end. In the arrangement of details
the shaman frequently employs the services of a lay assistant.
In these degenerate days a number of upstart pretenders to the healing
art have arisen in the tribe and endeavor to impose upon the
ignorance of their fellows by posing as doctors, although knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340">[pg 340]</a></span>
next to nothing of the prayers and ceremonies, without which there
can be no virtue in the application. These impostors are sternly
frowned down and regarded with the utmost contempt by the real
professors, both men and women, who have been initiated into the
sacred mysteries and proudly look upon themselves as conservators
of the ancient ritual of the past.</p>

<h3>THE CHEROKEE GODS AND THEIR ABIDING PLACES.</h3>

<p>After what has been said in elucidation of the theories involved
in the medical formulas, the most important and numerous of the
series, but little remains to be added in regard to the others, beyond
what is contained in the explanation accompanying each one. A
few points, however, may be briefly noted.</p>

<p>The religion of the Cherokees, like that of most of our North
American tribes, is zootheism or animal worship, with the survival
of that earlier stage designated by Powell as hecastotheism, or the
worship of all things tangible, and the beginnings of a higher system
in which the elements and the great powers of nature are deified.
Their pantheon includes gods in the heaven above, on the earth beneath,
and in the waters under the earth, but of these the animal
gods constitute by far the most numerous class, although the elemental
gods are more important. Among the animal gods insects
and fishes occupy a subordinate place, while quadrupeds, birds, and
reptiles are invoked almost constantly. The uktena (a mythic great
horned serpent), the rattlesnake, and the terrapin, the various species
of hawk, and the rabbit, the squirrel, and the dog are the principal
animal gods. The importance of the god bears no relation to the size
of the animal, and in fact the larger animals are but seldom invoked.
The spider also occupies a prominent place in the love and life-destroying
formulas, his duty being to entangle the soul of his victim
in the meshes of his web or to pluck it from the body of the doomed
man and drag it way to the black coffin in the Darkening Land.</p>

<p>Among what may be classed as elemental gods the principal are
fire, water, and the sun, all of which are addressed under figurative
names. The sun is called Une´‘lanû´hĭ, “the apportioner,”
just as our word moon means originally “the measurer.” Indians
and Aryans alike, having noticed how these great luminaries
divide and measure day and night, summer and winter, with never-varying
regularity, have given to each a name which should indicate
these characteristics, thus showing how the human mind constantly
moves on along the same channels. Missionaries have naturally,
but incorrectly, assumed this apportioner of all things to be
the suppositional “Great Spirit” of the Cherokees, and hence the
word is used in the Bible translation as synonymous with God. In
ordinary conversation and in the lesser myths the sun is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341">[pg 341]</a></span>
Nû´<sup>n</sup>tâ. The sun is invoked chiefly by the ball-player, while the
hunter prays to the fire; but every important ceremony&mdash;whether
connected with medicine, love, hunting, or the ball play&mdash;contains
a prayer to the “Long Person,” the formulistic name for water, or,
more strictly speaking, for the river. The wind, the storm, the
cloud, and the frost are also invoked in different formulas.</p>

<p>But few inanimate gods are included in the category, the principal
being the Stone, to which the shaman prays while endeavoring to
find a lost article by means of a swinging pebble suspended by a string;
the Flint, invoked when the shaman is about to scarify the patient
with a flint arrow-head before rubbing on the medicine; and the
Mountain, which is addressed in one or two of the formulas thus
far translated. Plant gods do not appear prominently, the chief one
seeming to be the ginseng, addressed in the formulas as the “Great
Man” or “Little Man,” although its proper Cherokee name signifies
the “Mountain Climber.”</p>

<p>A number of personal deities are also invoked, the principal being
the Red Man. He is one of the greatest of the gods, being repeatedly
called upon in formulas of all kinds, and is hardly subordinate to
the Fire, the Water, or the Sun. His identity is as yet uncertain,
but he seems to be intimately connected with the Thunder family. In
a curious marginal note in one of the Gahuni formulas (page <a href="#page350">350</a>), it
is stated that when the patient is a woman the doctor must pray to
the Red Man, but when treating a man he must pray to the Red
Woman, so that this personage seems to have dual sex characteristics.
Another god invoked in the hunting songs is Tsu´l’kalû´, or
“Slanting Eyes” (see Cherokee Myths), a giant hunter who lives in
one of the great mountains of the Blue Ridge and owns all the game.
Others are the Little Men, probably the two Thunder boys; the
Little People, the fairies who live in the rock cliffs; and even the
De´tsata, a diminutive sprite who holds the place of our Puck. One
unwritten formula, which could not be obtained correctly by dictation,
was addressed to the “Red-Headed Woman, whose hair hangs
down to the ground.”</p>

<p>The personage invoked is always selected in accordance with the
theory of the formula and the duty to be performed. Thus, when
a sickness is caused by a fish, the Fish-hawk, the Heron, or some
other fish-eating bird is implored to come and seize the intruder and
destroy it, so that the patient may find relief. When the trouble is
caused by a worm or an insect, some insectivorous bird is called in
for the same purpose. When a flock of redbirds is pecking at the
vitals of the sick man the Sparrow-hawk is brought down to scatter
them, and when the rabbit, the great mischief-maker, is the evil
genius, he is driven out by the Rabbit-hawk. Sometimes after the
intruder has been thus expelled “a small portion still remains,” in
the words of the formula, and accordingly the Whirlwind is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342">[pg 342]</a></span>
down from the treetops to carry the remnant to the uplands and
there scatter it so that it shall never reappear. The hunter prays
to the fire, from which he draws his omens; to the reed, from which
he makes his arrows; to Tsu´l’kalû, the great lord of the game, and
finally addresses in songs the very animals which he intends to kill.
The lover prays to the Spider to hold fast the affections of his
beloved one in the meshes of his web, or to the Moon, which looks
down upon him in the dance. The warrior prays to the Red War-club,
and the man about to set out on a dangerous expedition prays
to the Cloud to envelop him and conceal him from his enemies.</p>

<p>Each spirit of good or evil has its distinct and appropriate place
of residence. The Rabbit is declared to live in the broomsage on
the hillside, the Fish dwells in a bend of the river under the pendant
hemlock branches, the Terrapin lives in the great pond in the West,
and the Whirlwind abides in the leafy treetops. Each disease animal,
when driven away from his prey by some more powerful animal,
endeavors to find shelter in his accustomed haunt. It must be
stated here that the animals of the formulas are not the ordinary,
everyday animals, but their great progenitors, who live in the upper
world (galû´<sup>n</sup>lati) above the arch of the firmament.</p>

<h3>COLOR SYMBOLISM.</h3>

<p>Color symbolism plays an important part in the shamanistic system
of the Cherokees, no less than in that of other tribes. Each one
of the cardinal points has its corresponding color and each color its
symbolic meaning, so that each spirit invoked corresponds in color
and local habitation with the characteristics imputed to him, and is
connected with other spirits of the same name, but of other colors,
living in other parts of the upper world and differing widely in their
characteristics. Thus the Red Man, living in the east, is the spirit
of power, triumph, and success, but the Black Man, in the West, is
the spirit of death. The shaman therefore invokes the Red Man to
the assistance of his client and consigns his enemy to the fatal influences
of the Black Man.</p>

<p>The symbolic color system of the Cherokees, which will be explained
more fully in connection with the formulas, is as follows:</p>

<table summary="symbols" align="center">
<tr>
<td align="left">East</td>
<td align="left">= red</td>
<td align="left">= success; triumph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">North</td>
<td align="left">= blue</td>
<td align="left">= defeat; trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">West</td>
<td align="left">= black</td>
<td align="left">= death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">South</td>
<td align="left">= white</td>
<td align="left">= peace; happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Above?</td>
<td align="left">= brown</td>
<td align="left">= unascertained, but propitious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; </td>
<td align="left">= yellow </td>
<td align="left">= about the same as blue.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There is a great diversity in the color systems of the various tribes,
both as to the location and significance of the colors, but for obvious
reasons black was generally taken as the symbol of death; while
white and red signified, respectively, peace and war. It is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343">[pg 343]</a></span>
remarkable that red was the emblem of power and triumph among
the ancient Oriental nations no less than among the modern Cherokees.<a class="tag" name="tag139" id="tag139" href="#note139">139</a> </p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO NAMES.</h3>

<p>In many of the formulas, especially those relating to love and to
life-destroying, the shaman mentions the name and clan of his client,
of the intended victim, or of the girl whose affections it is desired to
win. The Indian regards his name, not as a mere label, but as a
distinct part of his personality, just as much as are his eyes or his
teeth, and believes that injury will result as surely from the malicious
handling of his name as from a wound inflicted on any part of
his physical organism. This belief was found among the various
tribes from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and has occasioned a number
of curious regulations in regard to the concealment and change of
names. It may be on this account that both Powhatan and Pocahontas
are known in history under assumed appellations, their true
names having been concealed from the whites until the pseudonyms
were too firmly established to be supplanted. Should his prayers
have no apparent effect when treating a patient for some serious illness,
the shaman sometimes concludes that the name is affected, and
accordingly goes to water, with appropriate ceremonies, and christens
the patient with a new name, by which he is henceforth to be
known. He then begins afresh, repeating the formulas with the
new name selected for the patient, in the confident hope that his
efforts will be crowned with success.</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE OF THE FORMULAS.</h3>

<p>A few words remain to be said in regard to the language of the
formulas. They are full of archaic and figurative expressions, many
of which are unintelligible to the common people, and some of which
even the shamans themselves are now unable to explain. These
archaic forms, like the old words used by our poets, lend a peculiar
beauty which can hardly be rendered in a translation. They frequently
throw light on the dialectic evolution of the language, as
many words found now only in the nearly extinct Lower Cherokee
dialect occur in formulas which in other respects are written in the
Middle or Upper dialect. The R sound, the chief distinguishing
characteristic of the old Lower dialect, of course does not occur, as
there are no means of indicating it in the Cherokee syllabary. Those
who are accustomed to look to the Bible for all beauty in sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344">[pg 344]</a></span>
expression will be surprised to find that these formulas abound in
the loftiest nights of poetic imagery. This is especially true of the
prayers used to win the love of a woman or to destroy the life of an
enemy, in which we find such expressions as&mdash;"Now your soul fades
away&mdash;your spirit shall grow less and dwindle away, never to reappear;"
“Let her be completely veiled in loneliness&mdash;O Black Spider,
may you hold her soul in your web, so that it may never get through
the meshes;” and the final declaration of the lover, “Your soul has
come into the very center of my soul, never to turn away.”</p>

<p>In the translation it has been found advisable to retain as technical
terms a few words which could not well be rendered literally, such as
ada´wĕhĭ and ugistā´‘tĭ. These words will be found explained in the
proper place. Transliterations of the Cherokee text of the formulas
are given, but it must be distinctly understood that the translations
are intended only as free renderings of the spirit of the originals,
exact translations with grammatic and glossarial notes being deferred
until a more extended study of the language has been made,
when it is hoped to present with more exactness of detail the whole
body of the formulas, of which the specimens here given are but a
small portion.</p>

<p>The facsimile formulas are copies from the manuscripts now in
possession of the Bureau of Ethnology, and the portraits are from
photographs taken by the author in the field.</p>

<h3>SPECIMEN FORMULAS.</h3>

<h4>NOTE ON THE ORTHOGRAPHY AND TRANSLATION.</h4>

<p>In the Cherokee text both <i>d</i> and <i>g</i> have a medial sound, approximating the
sounds of <i>t</i> and <i>k</i> respectively. The other letters are pronounced in regular
accordance
with the alphabet of the Bureau of Ethnology. The language abounds in
nasal and aspirate sounds, the most difficult of the latter being the aspirate <i>‘l</i>,
which to one familiar only with English sounds like <i>tl</i>.</p>

<p>A few words whose meaning could not be satisfactorily ascertained have been
distinctively indicated in the Cherokee text by means of italics. In the translation
the corresponding expression has been queried, or the space left entirely blank.
On examining the text the student can not fail to be struck by the great number
of verbs ending in <i>iga</i>. This is a peculiar form hardly ever used excepting in these
formulas, where almost every paragraph contains one or more such verbs. It implies
that the subject has just come and is now performing the action, and that
he came for that purpose. In addition to this, many of these verbs may be either
assertive or imperative (expressing entreaty), according to the accent. Thus
<i>hatû´<sup>n</sup>gani´ga</i> means “you have just come and are listening and it is for that
purpose
you came.” By slightly accenting the final syllable it becomes “come at once
to listen.” It will thus be seen that the great majority of the formulas are declarative
rather than petitional in form&mdash;laudatory rhapsodies instead of prayers, in the
ordinary sense of the word.</p>

drawn near to hearken. O great ada´wĕhĭ, you never fail in anything. Ha! It is
for you to loosen its hold on the bone. Belief is accomplished.</p>

<p>(Prescription.)&mdash;Lay a terrapin shell upon (the spot) and keep it there while the
five kinds (of spirits) listen. On finishing, then blow once. Repeat four times,
beginning each time from the start. On finishing the fourth time, then blow four
times. Have two white beads lying in the shell, together with a little of the medicine.
Don’t interfere with it, but have a good deal boiling in another vessel&mdash;a
bowl will do very well&mdash;and rub it on warm while treating by applying the hands.
And this is the medicine: What is called Yâ´na-Utsĕ´sta ("bear’s bed," the Aspidium
acrostichoides or Christmas fern); and the other is called Kâ´ga-Asgû´<sup>n</sup>tagĭ
("crow’s shin," the Adianthum pedatum or Maidenhair fern); and the other is the
common Egû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ (another fern); and the other is the Little Soft (-leaved)
Egû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ
(Osmunda Cinnamonea or cinnamon fern), which grows in the rocks and resembles
Yâna-Utsĕ´sta and is a small and soft (-leaved) Egû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ. Another has brown roots
and another has black roots. The roots of all should be (used).</p>

<p>Begin doctoring early in the morning; let the second (application) be while the
sun is still near the horizon; the third when it has risen to a considerable height
(10 a.m.); the fourth when it is above at noon. This is sufficient. (The doctor)
must not eat, and the patient also must be fasting.</p>
</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347">[pg 347]</a></span>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>As this formula is taken from the manuscript of Gahuni, who died
nearly thirty years ago, no definite statement of the theory of the
disease, or its treatment, can be given, beyond what is contained in
the formula itself, which, fortunately, is particularly explicit; most
doctors contenting themselves with giving only the words of the
prayer, without noting the ceremonies or even the medicine used.
There are various theories as to the cause of each disease, the most
common idea in regard to rheumatism being that it is caused by the
spirits of the slain animals, generally the deer, thirsting for vengeance
on the hunter, as has been already explained in the myth of
the origin of disease and medicine.</p>

<p>The measuring-worm (Catharis) is also held to cause rheumatism,
from the resemblance of its motions to those of a rheumatic
patient, and the name of the worm <i>wahhĭlĭ´</i> is frequently applied also
to the disease.</p>

<p>There are formulas to propitiate the slain animals, but these are
a part of the hunting code and can only be noticed here, although
it may be mentioned in passing that the hunter, when about to
return to the settlement, builds a fire in the path behind him, in
order that the deer chief may not be able to follow him to his home.</p>

<p>The disease, figuratively called the intruder (ulsgéta), is regarded
as a living being, and the verbs used in speaking of it show that it
is considered to be long, like a snake or fish. It is brought by
the deer chief and put into the body, generally the limbs, of the
hunter, who at once begins to suffer intense pain. It can be driven
out only by some more powerful animal spirit which is the natural
enemy of the deer, usually the dog or the Wolf. These animal gods
live up above beyond the seventh heaven and are the great prototypes
of which the earthly animals are only diminutive copies. They are
commonly located at the four cardinal points, each of which has a
peculiar formulistic name and a special color which applies to everything
in the same connection. Thus the east, north, west, and south
are respectively the Sun Land, the Frigid Land, the Darkening Land,
and Wă´hală´, while their respective mythologic colors are Red,
Blue, Black, and White. Wáhală is said to be a mountain far to the
south. The white or red spirits are generally invoked for peace,
health, and other blessings, the red alone for the success of an undertaking,
the blue spirits to defeat the schemes of an enemy or bring
down troubles upon him, and the black to compass his death. The
white and red spirits are regarded as the most powerful, and one of
these two is generally called upon to accomplish the final result.</p>

<p>In this case the doctor first invokes the Red Dog in the Sun Land,
calling him a great adáwehi, to whom nothing is impossible and
who never fails to accomplish his purpose. He is addressed as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348">[pg 348]</a></span>
out of sight in the distance and is implored to appear running swiftly
to the help of the sick man. Then the supplication changes to an
assertion and the doctor declares that the Red Dog has already arrived
to take the disease and has borne away a small portion of it to the
uttermost ends of the earth. In the second, third, and fourth paragraphs
the Blue Dog of the Frigid Land, the Black Dog of the
Darkening Land, and the White Dog of Wáhală are successively
invoked in the same terms and each bears away a portion of the
disease and disposes of it in the same way. Finally, in the fifth
paragraph, the White Terrapin of Wáhălă is invoked. He bears
off the remainder of the disease and the doctor declares that relief
is accomplished. The connection of the terrapin in this formula is
not evident, beyond the fact that he is regarded as having great
influence in disease, and in this case the beads and a portion of the
medicine are kept in a terrapin shell placed upon the diseased part
while the prayer is being recited.</p>

<p>The formulas generally consist of four paragraphs, corresponding
to four steps in the medical ceremony. In this case there are five,
the last being addressed to the terrapin instead of to a dog. The
prayers are recited in an undertone hardly audible at the distance of
a few feet, with the exception of the frequent <i>ha</i>, which seems to be
used as an interjection to attract attention and is always uttered in
a louder tone. The beads&mdash;which are here white, symbolic of relief&mdash;are
of common use in connection with these formulas, and are held
between the thumb and finger, placed upon a cloth on the ground,
or, as in this case, put into a terrapin shell along with a small portion
of the medicine. According to directions, the shell has no other
part in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The blowing is also a regular part of the treatment, the doctor
either holding the medicine in his mouth and blowing it upon the
patient, or, as it seems to be the case here, applying the medicine by
rubbing, and blowing his breath upon the spot afterwards. In some
formulas the simple blowing of the breath constitutes the whole
application. In this instance the doctor probably rubs the medicine
upon the affected part while reciting the first paragraph in a whisper,
after which he blows once upon the spot. The other paragraphs are
recited in the same manner, blowing once after each. In this way
the whole formula is repeated four times, with four blows at the end
of the final repetition. The directions imply that the doctor blows
only at the end of the whole formula, but this is not in accord with
the regular mode of procedure and seems to be a mistake.</p>

<p>The medicine consists of a warm decoction of the roots of four varieties
of fern, rubbed on with the hand. The awkward description of
the species shows how limited is the Indian’s power of botanic classification.
The application is repeated four times during the same morning,
beginning just at daybreak and ending at noon. Four is the sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349">[pg 349]</a></span>
number running through every detail of these formulas, there being
commonly four spirits invoked in four paragraphs, four blowings with
four final blows, four herbs in the decoction, four applications, and frequently
four days’ gaktu<sup>n</sup>´ta or tabu. In this case no tabu is specified
beyond the fact that both doctor and patient must be fasting. The
tabu generally extends to salt or lye, hot food and women, while in
rheumatism some doctors forbid the patient to eat the foot or leg of
any animal, the reason given being that the limbs are generally the
seat of the disease. For a similar reason the patient is also forbidden
to eat or even to touch a squirrel, a buffalo, a cat, or any animal which
“humps” itself. In the same way a scrofulous patient must not eat
turkey, as that bird seems to have a scrofulous eruption on its head,
while ball players must abstain from eating frogs, because the bones
of that animal are brittle and easily broken.</p>

<p>Yû! O Red Woman, you have caused it. You have put the intruder under him.

<p>This is just all of the prayer. Repeat it four times while laying on the hands.
After saying it over once, with the hands on (the body of the patient), take off the
hands and blow once, and at the fourth repetition blow four times. And this is
the medicine. Egû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ (a species of fern). Yâ´-na-Utsĕ´sta ("bear’s bed,"

Kâ´ga Asgû´<sup>n</sup>tagĕ ("crow’s shin," the Adiantum pedatum or Maidenhair fern) and

the
six varieties together and apply the hands warm with the medicine upon them.
Doctor in the evening. Doctor four consecutive nights. (The pay) is cloth and
moccasins; or, if one does not have them, just a little dressed deerskin and some cloth.</p>

<p>And this is the tabu for seven nights. One must not touch a squirrel, a dog, a
cat, the mountain trout, or women. If one is treating a married man they (<i>sic</i>)
must not touch his wife for four nights. And he must sit on a seat by himself for
four nights, and must not sit on the other seats for four nights.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>The treatment and medicine in this formula are nearly the same
as in that just given, which is also for rheumatism, both being
written by Gahuni. The prayer differs in several respects from any
other obtained, but as the doctor has been dead for years it is impossible
to give a full explanation of all the points. This is probably
the only formula in the collection in which the spirit invoked is the
“Red Woman,” but, as explained in the corner note at the top, this
is only the form used instead of “Red Man,” when the patient is a
man. The Red Man, who is considered perhaps the most powerful
god in the Cherokee pantheon, is in some way connected with the
thunder, and is invoked in a large number of formulas. The change
in the formula, according to the sex of the patient, brings to mind a
belief in Irish folk medicine, that in applying certain remedies the
doctor and patient must be of opposite sexes. The Red Man lives
in the east, in accordance with the regular mythologic color theory,
as already explained. The seats also are red, and the form of the
verb indicates that the Red Woman is either standing upon them
(plural) or sitting with her feet resting upon the rounds. These
seats or chairs are frequently mentioned in the formulas, and always
correspond in color with the spirit invoked. It is not clear why the
Red Woman is held responsible for the disease, which is generally
attributed to the revengeful efforts of the game, as already explained.
In agreement with the regular form, the disease is said to
be put under (not into) the patient. The assertion that the chairs
“have swiftly moved away” would seem from analogy to mean that
the disease has been placed upon the seats and thus borne away.
The verb implies that the seats move by their own volition. Immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351">[pg 351]</a></span>
afterward it is declared that relief is accomplished. The
expression “usû´hita nutanû´na” occurs frequently in these formulas,
and may mean either “let it not be for one night alone,” or “let
it not stay a single night,” according to the context.</p>

<p>The directions specify not only the medicine and the treatment,
but also the doctor’s fee. From the form of the verb the tabu, except
as regards the seat to be used by the sick person, seems to apply
to both doctor and patient. It is not evident why the mountain
trout is prohibited, but the dog, squirrel, and cat are tabued, as
already explained, from the fact that these animals frequently assume
positions resembling the cramped attitude common to persons
afflicted by rheumatism. The cat is considered especially uncanny,
as coming from the whites. Seven, as well as four, is a sacred
number with the tribe, being also the number of their gentes. It
will be noted that time is counted by nights instead of by days.</p>

<h4>THIS IS TO TREAT THEM IF THEY ARE BITTEN BY A SNAKE.</h4>

<div class="poem translation">

<p class="i2">Listen! Ha! It is only a common frog which has passed by and put it (the intruder) into you.</p>

<p class="i2">Listen! Ha! It is only an <i>Usu´‘gĭ</i> which has passed by and put it into you.</p>
</div>

<p>(Prescription.)&mdash;Now this at the beginning is a song. One should say it twice and
also say the second line twice. Rub tobacco (juice) on the bite for some time, or if
there be no tobacco just rub on saliva once. In rubbing it on, one must go around
four times. Go around toward the left and blow four times in a circle. This is because
in lying down the snake always coils to the right and this is just the same
(<i>lit.</i> “means like”) as uncoiling it.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This is also from the manuscript book of Gahuni, deceased, so that
no explanation could be obtained from the writer. The formula
consists of a song of two verses, each followed by a short recitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352">[pg 352]</a></span>
The whole is repeated, according to the directions, so as to make
four verses or songs; four, as already stated, being the sacred number
running through most of these formulas. Four blowings and
four circuits in the rubbing are also specified. The words used in
the songs are sometimes composed of unmeaning syllables, but in
this case dûnuwa and dayuha seem to have a meaning, although
neither the interpreter nor the shaman consulted could explain them,
which may be because the words have become altered in the song,
as frequently happens. Dûnu´wa appears to be an old verb, meaning
“it has penetrated,” probably referring to the tooth of the reptile.
These medicine songs are always sung in a low plaintive tone, somewhat
resembling a lullaby. Usu´‘gĭ also is without explanation, but
is probably the name of some small reptile or batrachian.</p>

<p>As in this case the cause of the trouble is evident, the Indians
have no theory to account for it. It may be remarked, however,
that when one dreams of being bitten, the same treatment and ceremonies
must be used as for the actual bite; otherwise, although
perhaps years afterward, a similar inflammation will appear on the
spot indicated in the dream, and will be followed by the same fatal
consequences. The rattlesnake is regarded as a supernatural being
or ada´wehi, whose favor must be propitiated, and great pains are
taken not to offend him. In consonance with this idea it is never
said among the people that a person has been bitten by a snake, but
that he has been “scratched by a brier.” In the same way, when an
eagle has been shot for a ceremonial dance, it is announced that “a
snowbird has been killed,” the purpose being to deceive the rattlesnake
or eagle spirits which might be listening.</p>

<p>The assertion that it is “only a common frog” or “only an Usu´‘gĭ”
brings out another characteristic idea of these formulas. Whenever
the ailment is of a serious character, or, according to the Indian
theory, whenever it is due to the influence of some powerful disease
spirit the doctor always endeavors to throw contempt upon the intruder,
and convince it of his own superior power by asserting the
sickness to be the work of some inferior being, just as a white physician
might encourage a patient far gone with consumption by telling
him that the illness was only a slight cold. Sometimes there is a
regular scale of depreciation, the doctor first ascribing the disease to
a rabbit or groundhog or some other weak animal, then in succeeding
paragraphs mentioning other still less important animals and
finally declaring it to be the work of a mouse, a small fish, or some
other insignificant creature. In this instance an ailment caused by
the rattlesnake, the most dreaded of the animal spirits, is ascribed
to a frog, one of the least importance.</p>

<p>In applying the remedy the song is probably sung while rubbing
the tobacco juice around the wound. Then the short recitation is
repeated and the doctor blows four times in a circle about the spot.

The whole ceremony is repeated four times. The curious directions
for uncoiling the snake have parallels in European folk medicine.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>The Cherokee name for this disease is Gu<sup>n</sup>wani´gistâĭ´, which signifies
that “something is causing something to eat,” or gnaw the
vitals of the patient. The disease attacks only infants of tender
age and the symptoms are nervousness and troubled sleep, from
which the child wakes suddenly crying as if frightened. The civilized
doctor would regard these as symptoms of the presence of
worms, but although the Cherokee name might seem to indicate the
same belief, the real theory is very different.</p>

<p>Cherokee mothers sometimes hush crying children, by telling them
that the screech owl is listening out in the woods or that the De´tsata&mdash;a
malicious little dwarf who lives in caves in the river bluffs&mdash;will
come and get them. This quiets the child for the time and is
so far successful, but the animals, or the De´tsata, take offense at
being spoken of in this way, and visit their displeasure upon the
<i>children born to the mother afterward</i>. This they do by sending an
animal into the body of the child to gnaw its vitals. The disease
is very common and there are several specialists who devote their
attention to it, using various formulas and prescriptions. It is also
called ătawi´nĕhĭ, signifying that it is caused by the “dwellers in
the forest,” i.e., the wild game and birds, and some doctors declare
that it is caused by the revengeful comrades of the animals, especially
birds, killed by the father of the child, the animals tracking
the slayer to his home by the blood drops on the leaves. The next
formula will throw more light upon this theory.</p>

<p>In this formula the doctor, who is certainly not overburdened
with modesty, starts out by asserting that he is a great ada´wehi,
who never fails and who surpasses all others. He then declares that
the disease is caused by a mere screech owl, which he at once banishes
to the laurel thicket. In the succeeding paragraphs he reiterates
his former boasting, but asserts in turn that the trouble is
caused by a mere hooting owl, a rabbit, or even by the De´tsata,
whose greatest exploit is hiding the arrows of the boys, for which
the youthful hunters do not hesitate to rate him soundly. These
various mischief-makers the doctor banishes to their proper haunts,
the hooting owl to the spruce thicket, the rabbit to the broom sage
on the mountain side, and the De´tsata to the bluffs along the river bank.</p>

<p>Some doctors use herb decoctions, which are blown upon the body
of the child, but in this formula the only remedy prescribed is
water, which must be blown upon the body of the little sufferer
just before dark for four nights. The regular method is to blow
once each at the end of the first, second, and third paragraphs and
four times at the end of the fourth or last. In diseases of this kind,
which are not supposed to be of a local character, the doctor blows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355">[pg 355]</a></span>
first upon the back of the head, then upon the left shoulder, next
upon the right shoulder, and finally upon the breast, the patient
being generally sitting, or propped up in bed, facing the east. The
child must not be taken out of doors during the four days, because
should a bird chance to fly overhead so that its shadow would fall
upon the infant, it would <i>fan the disease back</i> into the body of the little one.</p>

<h4>TO TREAT GÛ<sup>n</sup>WANI´GISTÛ´<sup>n</sup>Ĭ&mdash;(SECOND).</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Yû! Listen! Quickly you have drawn near to hearken, O Blue Sparrow-Hawk;

</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, also for Gû<sup>n</sup>wani´gistû´<sup>n</sup>ĭ or Atawinĕ´hĭ, was obtained
from A‘wan´ita (Young Deer), who wrote down only the prayer and
explained the treatment orally. He coincides in the opinion that
this disease in children is caused by the birds, but says that it originates
from the shadow of a bird flying overhead having fallen
upon the pregnant mother. He says further that the disease is
easily recognized in children, but that it sometimes does not develop
until the child has attained maturity, when it is more difficult to
discern the cause of the trouble, although in the latter case dark
circles around the eyes are unfailing symptoms.</p>

<p>The prayer&mdash;like several others from the same source&mdash;seems incomplete,
and judging from analogy is evidently incorrect in some
respects, but yet exemplifies the disease theory in a striking manner.
The disease is declared to have been caused by the birds, it being
asserted in the first paragraph that a bird has cast its shadow upon
the sufferer, while in the second it is declared that they have gathered
in council (in his body). This latter is a favorite expression in
these formulas to indicate the great number of the disease animals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356">[pg 356]</a></span>
Another expression of frequent occurrence is to the effect that the
disease animals have formed a settlement or established a townhouse
in the patient’s body. The disease animal, being a bird or birds,
must be dislodged by something which preys upon birds, and accordingly
the Blue Sparrow-Hawk from the tree tops and the Brown
Rabbit-Hawk (Diga´tiskĭ&mdash;"One who snatches up"), from above are
invoked to drive out the intruders. The former is then said to have
swooped down upon them as a hawk darts upon its prey, while the
latter is declared to have scattered the birds which were holding a
council. This being done, relief is accomplished. Yû! is a meaningless
interjection frequently used to introduce or close paragraphs or songs.</p>

<p>The medicine used is a warm decoction of the bark of Kûnstû´tsĭ
(Sassafras&mdash;Sassafras officinale), Kanû<sup>n</sup>si´ta (Flowering Dogwood&mdash;Cornus
florida), Udâ´lana (Service tree&mdash;Amelanchier Canadensis),
and Uni´kwa (Black Gum&mdash;Nyssa multiflora), with the roots of two
species (large and small) of Da´yakalĭ´skĭ (Wild Rose&mdash;Rosa lucida).
The bark in every case is taken from the east side of the tree, and
the roots selected are also generally, if not always, those growing
toward the east. In this case the roots and barks are not bruised,
but are simply steeped in warm water for four days. The child is
then stripped and bathed all over with the decoction morning and
night for four days, no formula being used during the bathing. It
is then made to hold up its hands in front of its face with the palms
turned out toward the doctor, who takes some of the medicine in his
mouth and repeats the prayer mentally, blowing the medicine upon
the head and hands of the patient at the final <i>Yû!</i> of each paragraph.
It is probable that the prayer originally consisted of four paragraphs,
or else that these two paragraphs were repeated. The child
drinks a little of the medicine at the end of each treatment.</p>

<p>The use of salt is prohibited during the four days of the treatment,
the word (amă´) being understood to include lye, which enters largely
into Cherokee food preparations. No chicken or other feathered
animal is allowed to enter the house during the same period, for
obvious reasons, and strangers are excluded for reasons already explained.</p>

<p>(Prescription)&mdash;This is to treat them if there are pains moving about in the teeth.
It is only (necessary) to lay on the hands, or to blow, if one should prefer. One
may use any kind of a tube, but usually they have the medicine in the mouth. It
is the Yellow-rooted Grass (kane´ ska dalâ´nige unaste´tla; not identified.) One must
abstain four nights from cooked corn (hominy), and kanâhe´na (fermented corn
gruel) is especially forbidden during the same period.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula is taken from the manuscript book of Gatigwanasti,
now dead, and must therefore be explained from general analogy.
The ailment is described as “pains moving about in the teeth”&mdash;that
is, affecting several teeth simultaneously&mdash;and appears to be
neuralgia. The disease spirit is called “the intruder” and “the
tormentor” and is declared to be a mere worm (tsgâ´ya), which has
wrapped itself around the base of the tooth. This is the regular
toothache theory. The doctor then calls upon the Red Spider of
the Sunland to let down the red threads from above, along the red
path, and to take up the intruder, which is just what the spider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359">[pg 359]</a></span>
eats. The same prayer is addressed in turn to the Blue Spider in
the north, the Black Spider in the west and the White Spider above
(galû<sup>n</sup>´lati). It may be stated here that all these spirits are supposed
to dwell above, but when no point of the compass is assigned,
galû<sup>n</sup>´lati is understood to mean directly overhead, but far above
everything of earth. The dweller in this overhead galû<sup>n</sup>´lati may
be red, white, or brown in color. In this formula it is white, the
ordinary color assigned spirits dwelling in the south. In another
toothache formula the Squirrel is implored to take the worm and
put it between the forking limbs of a tree on the north side of the mountain.</p>

<p>Following each supplication to the spider is another addressed to
the Ancient White, the formulistic name for fire. The name refers
to its antiquity and light-giving properties and perhaps also to the
fact that when dead it is covered with a coat of white ashes. In
those formulas in which the hunter draws omens from the live coals
it is frequently addressed as the Ancient Red.</p>

<p>The directions are not explicit and must be interpreted from analogy.
“Laying on the hands” refers to pressing the thumb against
the jaw over the aching tooth, the hand having been previously
warmed over the fire, this being a common method of treating toothache.
The other method suggested is to blow upon the spot (tooth
or outside of jaw?) a decoction of an herb described rather vaguely
as “yellow-rooted grass” either through a tube or from the mouth
of the operator. Igawĭ´, a toothache specialist, treats this ailment
either by pressure with the warm thumb, or by blowing tobacco
smoke from a pipe placed directly against the tooth. Hominy and
fermented corn gruel (kanâhe´na) are prohibited for the regular
term of four nights, or, as we are accustomed to say, four days, and
special emphasis is laid upon the gruel tabu.</p>

<p>The prayer to the Spider is probably repeated while the doctor is
warming his hands over the fire, and the following paragraph to
the Ancient White (the Fire) while holding the warm thumb upon
the aching spot. This reverses the usual order, which is to address
the fire while warming the hands. In this connection it must be
noted that the fire used by the doctor is never the ordinary fire on

fire and generally placed in an earthen vessel by the side of the
patient. In some cases the decoction is heated by putting into it
seven live coals taken from the fire on the hearth.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>Unawa´stĭ, “that which chills one,” is a generic name for intermittent
fever, otherwise known as fever and ague. It is much dreaded
by the Indian doctors, who recognize several varieties of the disease,
and have various theories to account for them. The above formula
was obtained from A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>ni (Swimmer), who described the symptoms
of this variety, the “Great Chill,” as blackness in the face,
with alternate high fever and shaking chills. The disease generally
appeared in spring or summer, and might return year after year. In
the first stages the chill usually came on early in the morning, but
came on later in the day as the disease progressed. There might be
more than one chill during the day. There was no rule as to appetite,
but the fever always produced an excessive thirst. In one
instance the patient fainted from the heat and would even lie down in
a stream to cool himself. The doctor believed the disease was caused
by malicious tsgâ´ya, a general name for all small insects and worms,
excepting intestinal worms. These tsgâ´ya&mdash;that is, the disease tsgâ´ya,
not the real insects and worms&mdash;are held responsible for a large
number of diseases, and in fact the tsgâ´ya doctrine is to the Cherokee
practitioner what the microbe theory is to some modern scientists.
The tsgâ´ya live in the earth, in the water, in the air, in the foliage
of trees, in decaying wood, or wherever else insects lodge, and as
they are constantly being crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed
through the unthinking carelessness of the human race, they are
continually actuated by a spirit of revenge. To accomplish their
vengeance, according to the doctors, they “establish towns” under
the skin of their victims, thus producing an irritation which results
in fevers, boils, scrofula and other diseases.</p>

<p>The formula begins with a song of four verses, in which the doctor
invokes in succession the spirits of the air, of the mountain, of
the forest, and of the water. Galû<sup>n</sup>latĭ, the word used in the first
verse, signifies, as has been already explained, “on high” or “above
everything,” and has been used by translators to mean heaven.
Û<sup>n</sup>wadâ´hĭ in the second verse is the name of a bald mountain east
of Webster, North Carolina, and is used figuratively to denote any
mountains of bold outline. The Cherokees have a tradition to account
for the name, which is derived from Û<sup>n</sup>wadâ´lĭ, “provision
house.” Nâ´tsihĭ´ in the third verse signifies “pinery,” from nâ´‘tsĭ,
“pine,” but is figuratively used to denote a forest of any kind.</p>

<p>In the recitation which follows the song, but is used only in serious
cases, the doctor prays to the whirlwind, which is considered to
dwell among the trees on the mountain side, where the trembling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362">[pg 362]</a></span>
the leaves always gives the first intimation of its presence. He declares
that a small portion of the disease still remains, the spirits
invoked in the song having already taken the rest, and calls upon
the whirlwind to lay down a path for it and sweep it away into the
swamp on the upland, referring to grassy marshes common in the
small coves of the higher mountains, which, being remote from the
settlements, are convenient places to which to banish the disease.
Not satisfied with this, he goes on to direct the whirlwind to scatter
the disease as it scatters the leaves of the forest, so that it shall
utterly disappear. In the Cherokee formula the verb a‘ne´tsâge´ta
means literally “to play,” and is generally understood to refer to the
ball play, a´ne´tsâ, so that to a Cherokee the expression conveys the
idea of catching up the disease and driving it onward as a player
seizes the ball and sends it spinning through the air from between
his ball sticks. Niga´gĭ is a solemn expression about equivalent to
the Latin consummatum est.</p>

<p>The doctor beats up some bark from the trunk of the wild cherry
and puts it into water together with seven coals of fire, the latter being
intended to warm the decoction. The leaves of Tsâl-agayû´<sup>n</sup>li
(Indian tobacco&mdash;Nicotiana rustica) are sometimes used in place of
the wild cherry bark. The patient is placed facing the sunrise, and
the doctor, taking the medicine in his mouth, blows it over the body
of the sick man. First, standing between the patient and the sunrise
and holding the medicine cup in his hand, he sings the first verse
in a low tone. Then, taking some of the liquid in his mouth, he advances
and blows it successively upon the top of the head, the right
shoulder, left shoulder, and breast or back of the patient, making
four blowings in all. He repeats the same ceremony with the second,
third, and fourth verse, returning each time to his original
position. The ceremony takes place in the morning, and if necessary
is repeated in the evening. It is sometimes necessary also to repeat
the treatment for several&mdash;generally four&mdash;consecutive days.</p>

<p>The recitation is not used excepting in the most serious cases,
when, according to the formula, “a very small portion” of the disease
still lingers. It is accompanied by blowing <i>of the breath alone</i>, without
medicine, probably in this case typical of the action of the whirlwind.
After repeating the whole ceremony accompanying the song,
as above described, the doctor returns to his position in front of the
patient and recites in a whisper the first paragraph to the Little
Whirlwind, after which he advances and blows his breath upon the
patient four times as he has already blown the medicine upon him.
Then going around to the north he recites the second paragraph to
the Great Whirlwind, and at its conclusion blows in the same manner.
Then moving around to the west&mdash;behind the patient&mdash;he again
prays to the Little Whirlwind with the same ceremonies, and finally
moving around to the south side he closes with the prayer to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363">[pg 363]</a></span>
Great Whirlwind, blowing four times at its conclusion. The medicine
must be prepared anew by the doctor at the house of the patient
at each application morning or evening. Only as much as will be
needed is made at a time, and the patient always drinks what remains
after the blowing. Connected with the preparation and care
of the medicine are a number of ceremonies which need not be detailed
here. The wild cherry bark must always be procured fresh;
but the Tsâl-agayû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ ("Old Tobacco") leaves may be dry. When
the latter plant is used four leaves are taken and steeped in warm
water with the fire coals, as above described.</p>

<p>Listen! You little woman, get up now at once. There comes your grandfather.
The horrible old fellow is coming only a little way off. Listen! Quick! Get your
bed and let us run away. Yû!</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>In this formula for childbirth the idea is to frighten the child and
coax it to come, by telling it, if a boy, that an ugly old woman is coming,
or if a girl, that her grandfather is coming only a short distance
away. The reason of this lies in the fact that an old woman is the
terror of all the little boys of the neighborhood, constantly teasing
and frightening them by declaring that she means to live until
they grow up and then compel one of them to marry her, old and
shriveled as she is. For the same reason the maternal grandfather,
who is always a privileged character in the family, is especially
dreaded by the little girls, and nothing will send a group of children
running into the house more quickly than the announcement that an
old “granny,” of either sex is in sight.</p>

<p>As the sex is an uncertain quantity, the possible boy is always first
addressed in the formulas, and if no result seems to follow, the
doctor then concludes that the child is a girl and addresses her in similar
tones. In some cases an additional formula with the beads is used
to determine whether the child will be born alive or dead. In most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364">[pg 364]</a></span>
instances the formulas were formerly repeated with the appropriate
ceremonies by some old female relative of the mother, but they are
now the property of the ordinary doctors, men as well as women.</p>

<p>This formula was obtained from the manuscript book of A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ,
who stated that the medicine used was a warm decoction of a plant
called Dalâ´nige Unaste´tsĭ ("yellow root"&mdash;not identified), which
was blown successively upon the top of the mother’s head, upon the
breast, and upon the palm of each hand. The doctor stands beside
the woman, who is propped up in a sitting position, while repeating
the first paragraph and then blows. If this produces no result he
then recites the paragraph addressed to the girl and again blows.
A part of the liquid is also given to the woman to drink. A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ
claimed this was always effectual.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula was obtained from Takwati´hĭ, as given to him by a
specialist in this line. Takwatihi himself knew nothing of the treatment
involved, but a decoction is probably blown upon the patient
as described in the preceding formula. In many cases the medicine
used is simply cold water, the idea being to cause a sudden muscular
action by the chilling contact. In this formula the possible boy or
girl is coaxed out by the promise of a bow or a meal-sifter to the
one who can get it first. Among the Cherokees it is common, in
asking about the sex of a new arrival, to inquire, “Is it a bow or a
sifter?” or “Is it ball sticks or bread?”</p>

<p>(Directions.)&mdash;This is to treat them when their breast swells. Fire (coals) is not

</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ’s manuscript, is used in treating
a disease known as Dalâni, literally, “yellow.” From the vague
description of symptoms given by the doctors, it appears to be an
aggravated form of biliousness, probably induced by late suppers and
bad food. According to the Indian theory it is caused by revengeful
animals, especially by the terrapin and its cousin, the turtle.</p>

<p>The doctors recognize several forms of the disease, this variety
being distinguished as the “black dalâni” (Dalâni Û<sup>n</sup>nage´ĭ) and considered
the most dangerous. In this form of dalânĭ, according to
their account, the navel and abdomen of the patient swell, the ends
of his fingers become black, dark circles appear about his eyes, and
the throat contracts spasmodically and causes him to fall down suddenly
insensible. A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ’s method of treatment is to rub the
breast and abdomen of the patient with the hands, which have been
previously rubbed together in the warm infusion of wild cherry
(ta´ya) bark. The song is sung while rubbing the hands together in
the liquid, and the prayer is repeated while rubbing the swollen abdomen
of the patient. The operation may be repeated several times
on successive days.</p>

<p>The song at the beginning has no meaning and is sung in a low
plaintive lullaby tone, ending with a sharp <i>Yu!</i> The prayer possesses
a special interest, as it brings out several new points in the
Cherokee mythologic theory of medicine. The “intruder,” which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366">[pg 366]</a></span>
is held to be some amphibious animal&mdash;as a terrapin, turtle, or snake&mdash;is
declared to have risen up from his dwelling place in the great
lake, situated toward the sunset, and to have come by stealth under
the sick man. The verb implies that the disease spirit <i>creeps under</i>
as a snake might crawl under the coverlet of a bed.</p>

<p>The two Little Men in the Sun Land are now invoked to drive out
the disease. Who these Little Men are is not clear, although they
are regarded as most powerful spirits and are frequently invoked in
the formulas. They are probably the two Thunder Boys, sons of Kanati.</p>

<p>The Little Men come instantly when summoned by the shaman,
pull out the intruder from the body of the patient, turn his face toward
the sunset, and begin to drive him on by threats and blows
(expressed in the word gû´<sup>n</sup>tsatatagi´yû) to the great lake from
which he came. On the road there are four gaps in the mountains,
at each of which the disease spirit halts to rest, but is continually
forced onward by his two pursuers, who finally drive him into the
lake, where he is compelled to remain, without being permitted even
to look back again. The four gaps are mentioned also in other
formulas for medicine and the ball play and sometimes correspond
with the four stages of the treatment. The direction “No fire (coals)
is put down” indicates that no live coals are put into the decoction,
the doctor probably using water warmed in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>Takwati´hĭ uses for this disease a decoction of four herbs applied
in the same manner. He agrees with A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ in regard to the
general theory and says also that the disease may be contracted by
neglecting to wash the hands after handling terrapin shells, as, for
instance, the shell rattles used by women in the dance. The turtle
or water tortoise (seligu´gĭ) is considered as an inferior being, with
but little capacity for mischief, and is feared chiefly on account of
its relationship to the dreaded terrapin or land tortoise (tûksĭ´). In
Takwatihĭ’s formula he prays to the Ancient White (the fire), of
which these cold-blooded animals are supposed to be afraid, to put
the fish into the water, the turtle into the mud, and to send the terrapin
and snake to the hillside.</p>

<p>(Directions)&mdash;This is to treat them for a painful sickness. One must suck. Use
Tsâ´lagayû<sup>n</sup>´-li ("Old Tobacco"&mdash;Nicotiana rustica), blossoms, and just have them in
the mouth, and Kanasâ´la (Wild Parsnip), goes with it, and four red beads also must
lie there, and Tsâliyu´sti Usdi´ga ("Little (plant) Like Tobacco"&mdash;Indian
Tobacco&mdash;Lobelia
inflata.) And if there should be anything mixed with it (i.e., after sucking
the place), just put it about a hand’s-length into the mud.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>The Cherokee name for this disease gives no idea whatever of its
serious nature. The technical term, Tsundaye´liga´ktanû´hĭ, really
refers to the enthusiastic outburst of sociability that ensues when
two old friends meet. In this instance it might be rendered “an
ordeal.” The application of such a name to what is considered a
serious illness is in accordance with the regular formulistic practice
of making light of a dangerous malady in order to convey to the
disease spirit the impression that the shaman is not afraid of him.
A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ, from whom the formula was obtained, states also that the
disease is sometimes sent to a man by a friend or even by his parents,
in order to test his endurance and knowledge of counter spells.</p>

<p>As with most diseases, the name simply indicates the shaman’s
theory of the occult cause of the trouble, and is no clue to the
symptoms, which may be those usually attendant upon fevers, indigestion,
or almost any other ailment.</p>

<p>In some cases the disease is caused by the conjurations of an
enemy, through which the patient becomes subject to an inordinate
appetite, causing him to eat until his abdomen is unnaturally distended.
By the same magic spells tobacco may be conveyed into
the man’s body, causing him to be affected by faintness and languor.
The enemy, if bitterly revengeful, may even put into the body of
his victim a worm or insect (tsgâya), or a sharpened stick of black
locust or “fat” pine, which will result in death if not removed by
a good doctor. Sometimes a weed stalk is in some occult manner
conveyed into the patient’s stomach, where it is transformed into a
worm. As this disease is very common, owing to constant quarrels
and rival jealousies, there are a number of specialists who devote
their attention to it.</p>

<p>The prayer is addressed to the Black, Red, Blue, and White
Ravens, their location at the four cardinal points not being specified,
excepting in the case of the white raven of Wa´hilĭ, which, as
already stated, is said to be a mountain in the south, and hence is
used figuratively to mean the south. The ravens are each in turn
declared to have put the disease into a crevice in Sanigala´gi&mdash;the
Cherokee name of Whiteside Mountain, at the head of Tuckasegee
River, in North Carolina, and used figuratively for any high precipitous
mountain&mdash;and to have left no more than a trace upon the
ground where it has been. The adjective translated “evolute”
(udanûhĭ) is of frequent occurrence in the formulas, but has no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369">[pg 369]</a></span>
exact equivalent in English. It signifies springing into being or
life from an embryonic condition. In this instance it would imply
that whatever object the enemy has put into the body of the sick
man has there developed into a ghost to trouble him.</p>

<p>The directions are expressed in a rather vague manner, as is the
case with most of A‘yû<sup>n</sup>ini’s attempts at original composition. The
disease is here called by another name, agi‘li´ya unitlû<sup>n</sup>gû´<sup>n</sup>ĭ, signifying
“when they are painfully sick.” The treatment consists in sucking
the part most affected, the doctor having in his mouth during
the operation the blossoms of Tsâ´l-agayû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ (Nicotiana rustica),
Kanasâ´la (wild parsnip,) and Tsâliyusti Usdiga (Lobelia inflata.)
The first and last of these names signify “tobacco” and “tobacco-like,”
while the other seems to contain the same word, tsâ´la, and the
original idea may have been to counteract the witchcraft by the use
of the various species of “tobacco,” the herb commonly used to drive
away a witch or wizard. During the sucking process four red beads
lie near upon a piece of (white) cloth, which afterward becomes the
perquisite of the doctor. Though not explicitly stated, it is probable
that the doctor holds in his mouth a decoction of the blossoms
named, rather than the blossoms themselves. On withdrawing his
mouth from the spot and ejecting the liquid into a bowl, it is expected
that there will be found “mixed” with it a small stick, a pebble, an
insect, or something of the kind, and this the shaman then holds up
to view as the cause of the disease. It is afterward buried a “hand’s
length” (awâ´hilû)<a class="tag" name="tag142" id="tag142" href="#note142">142</a>  deep in the mud. No directions were given as
to diet or tabu.</p>

<h4>CONCERNING HUNTING.</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Give me the wind. Give me the breeze. Yû! O Great Terrestrial Hunter, I
come to the edge of your spittle where you repose. Let your stomach cover itself;
let it be covered with leaves. Let it cover itself at a single bend, and may you
never be satisfied.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370">[pg 370]</a></span>

<p>And you, O Ancient Red, may you hover above my breast while I sleep. Now

covered with the clotted blood, and may it never cease to be so. You two (the
Water and the Fire) shall bury it in your stomachs. Yû!</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This is a hunting formula, addressed to the two great gods of the
hunter, Fire and Water. The evening before starting the hunter
“goes to water,” as already explained, and recites the appropriate
formula. In the morning he sets out, while still fasting, and travels
without eating or drinking until nightfall. At sunset he again goes
to water, reciting this formula during the ceremony, after which he
builds his camp fire, eats his supper and lies down for the night,
first rubbing his breast with ashes from the fire. In the morning he
starts out to look for game.</p>

<p>"Give me the wind," is a prayer that the wind may be in his favor,
so that the game may not scent him. The word rendered here
“Great Terrestrial Hunter,” is in the original “Ela-Kana´tĭ.” In this
<i>e´la</i> is the earth and <i>kana´tĭ</i> is a term applied to a successful hunter.
The great Kanatĭ, who, according to the myth, formerly kept all
the game shut up in his underground caverns, now dwells above the
sky, and is frequently invoked by hunters. The raven also is often addressed
as Kanatĭ in these hunting formulas. Ela-Kana´tĭ, the Great
Terrestrial Hunter&mdash;as distinguished from the other two&mdash;signifies
the river, the name referring to the way in which the tiny streams
and rivulets search out and bring down to the great river the leaves
and débris of the mountain forests. In formulas for medicine, love,
the ball play, etc., the river is always addressed as the Long Person
(Yû´<sup>n</sup>wĭ Gûnahi´ta). The “spittle” referred to is the foam at the
edge of the water. “Let your stomach be covered with leaves”
means, let the blood-stained leaves where the stricken game shall
fall be so numerous as to cover the surface of the water. The hunter
prays also that sufficient game may be found in a single bend of the
river to accomplish this result without the necessity of searching
through the whole forest, and to that end he further prays that
the river may never be satisfied, but continually longing for more.
The same idea is repeated in the second paragraph. The hunter is
supposed to feed the river with blood washed from the game. In
like manner he feeds the fire, addressed in the second paragraph as
the “Ancient Red,” with a piece of meat cut from the tongue of the
deer. The prayer that the fire may hover above his breast while he
sleeps and brings him favorable dreams, refers to his rubbing his
breast with ashes from his camp fire before lying down to sleep, in
order that the fire may bring him dream omens of success for the
morrow. The Fire is addressed either as the Ancient White or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371">[pg 371]</a></span>
Ancient Red, the allusion in the first case being to the light or the
ashes of the fire; in the other case, to the color of the burning coals.
“You two shall bury it in your stomachs” refers to the blood-stained
leaves and the piece of meat which are cast respectively into
the river and the fire. The formula was obtained from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ,
who explained it in detail.</p>

<h4>THIS IS FOR HUNTING BIRDS.</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Listen! O Ancient White, where you dwell in peace I have come to rest. Now
let your spirit arise. Let it (the game brought down) be buried in your stomach,
and may your appetite never be satisfied. The red hickories have tied themselves
together. The clotted blood is your recompense.</p>

<p>O Ancient White, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Accept the clotted blood (?)</p>

<p>O Ancient White, put me in the successful hunting trail. Hang the mangled
things upon me. Let me come along the successful trail with them doubled up
(under my belt). It (the road) is clothed with the mangled things.</p>

<p>O Ancient White, O Kanati, support me continually, that I may never become
blue. Listen!</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ’s manuscript, is recited by the bird-hunter
in the morning while standing over the fire at his hunting
camp before starting out for the day’s hunt. A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ stated that
seven blowgun arrows are first prepared, including a small one only
a “hand-length” (awâ´hilû) long. On rising in the morning the
hunter, standing over the fire, addresses it as the “Ancient White.”
rubbing his hands together while repeating the prayer. He then
sets out for the hunting ground, where he expects to spend the day,
and on reaching it he shoots away the short arrow at random, without
attempting to trace its flight. There is of course some significance
attached to this action and perhaps an accompanying prayer,
but no further information upon this point was obtainable. Having
shot away the magic arrow, the hunter utters a peculiar hissing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372">[pg 372]</a></span>
sound, intended to call up the birds, and then goes to work with his
remaining arrows. On all hunting expeditions it is the regular practice,
religiously enforced, to abstain from food until sunset.</p>

<p>A favorite method with the bird-hunter during the summer season
is to climb a gum tree, which is much frequented by the smaller
birds on account of its berries, where, taking up a convenient position
amid the branches with his noiseless blowgun and arrows, he
deliberately shoots down one bird after another until his shafts are
exhausted, when he climbs down, draws out the arrows from the
bodies of the birds killed, and climbs up again to repeat the operation.
As the light darts used make no sound, the birds seldom
take the alarm, and are too busily engaged with the berries to notice
their comrades dropping to the ground from time to time, and pay
but slight attention even to the movements of the hunter.</p>

<p>The prayer is addressed to the Ancient White (the Fire), the spirit
most frequently invoked by the hunter, who, as before stated, rubs
his hands together over the fire while repeating the words. The expressions
used are obscure when taken alone, but are full of meaning
when explained in the light of the hunting customs. The “clotted
blood” refers to the bloodstained leaves upon which the fallen game
has lain. The expression occurs constantly in the hunting formulas.
The hunter gathers up these bloody leaves and casts them upon the
fire, in order to draw omens for the morrow from the manner in
which they burn. A part of the tongue, or some other portion of
the animal, is usually cast upon the coals also for the same purpose.
This subject will be treated at length in a future account of the
hunting ceremonies.</p>

<p>"Let it be buried in your stomach" refers also to the offering made
the fire. By the red hickories are meant the strings of hickory bark
which the bird hunter twists about his waist for a belt. The dead
birds are carried by inserting their heads under this belt. Red is,
of course, symbolic of his success. “The mangled things” (unigwalû´<sup>n</sup>gĭ)
are the wounded birds. Kana´tĭ is here used to designate the
fire, on account of its connection with the hunting ceremonies.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This short formula, obtained from Â‘wani´ta, is recited by the
hunter while taking aim. The bowstring is let go&mdash;or, rather, the
trigger is pulled&mdash;at the final <i>Yû!</i> He was unable to explain the
meaning of the word selagwû´tsĭ further than that it referred to the
bullet. Later investigation, however, revealed the fact that this
is the Cherokee name of a reed of the genus Erianthus, and the inference
follows that the stalk of the plant was formerly used for
arrow shafts. Red implies that the arrow is always successful in
reaching the mark aimed at, and in this instance may refer also to
its being bloody when withdrawn from the body of the animal.
Inagĕ´hĭ, “dwellers in the wilderness,” is the generic term for game,
including birds, but A‘wani´ta has another formula intended especially for deer.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This song, obtained from A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ in connection with the story of
the Origin of the Bear, as already mentioned, is sung by the bear
hunter, in order to attract the bears, while on his way from the
camp to the place where he expects to hunt during the day. It is
one of those taught the Cherokees by the Ani-Tsâ´kahĭ before they
lost their human shape and were transformed into bears. The
melody is simple and plaintive.</p>

<p>The song consists of four verses followed by a short recitation.
Each verse begins with a loud prolonged <i>He+!</i> and ends with
<i>Yoho´+!</i> uttered in the same manner. Hayuya´haniwă´ has no meaning.
Tsistu´yĭ, Kuwâ´hĭ, Uyâ´‘yĕ, and Gâte´kwâhĭ are four mountains,
in each of which the bears have a townhouse and hold a dance before
going into their dens for the winter. The first three named are high
peaks in the Smoky Mountains, on the Tennessee line, in the neighborhood
of Clingman’s Dome and Mount Guyot. The fourth is
southeast of Franklin, North Carolina, toward the South Carolina
line, and may be identical with Fodderstack Mountain. In Kuwahi
dwells the great bear chief and doctor, in whose magic bath the
wounded bears are restored to health. They are said to originate or
be conceived in the mountains named, because these are their headquarters.
The “good black things” referred to in the recitation are the bears.</p>

<h4>THIS IS FOR CATCHING LARGE FISH.</h4>

<p class="translation">
Listen! Now you settlements have drawn near to hearken. Where you have
gathered in the foam you are moving about as one. You Blue Cat and the others,
I have come to offer you freely the white food. Let the paths from every direction
recognize each other. Our spittle shall be in agreement. Let them (your and my
spittle) be together as we go about. They (the fish) have become a prey and there
shall be no loneliness. Your spittle has become agreeable. I am called Swimmer. Yû!</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ´s’ book, is for the purpose of catching
large fish. According to his instructions, the fisherman must first
chew a small piece of Yugwilû´ (Venus’ Flytrap&mdash;Dionæa muscipula)
and spit it upon the bait and also upon the hook. Then, standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375">[pg 375]</a></span>
facing the stream, he recites the formula and puts the bait upon the
hook. He will be able to pull out a fish at once, or if the fish are
not about at the moment they will come in a very short time.</p>

<p>The Yugwilû´ is put upon the bait from the idea that it will enable
the hook to attract and hold the fish as the plant itself seizes and
holds insects in its cup. The root is much prized by the Cherokees
for this purpose, and those in the West, where the plant is not found,
frequently send requests for it to their friends in Carolina.</p>

<p>The prayer is addressed directly to the fish, who are represented
as living in settlements. The same expression as has already been
mentioned is sometimes used by the doctors in speaking of the
<i>tsgâ´ya</i> or worms which are supposed to cause sickness by getting
under the skin of the patient. The Blue Cat (<i>Amiurus, genus</i>) is
addressed as the principal fish and the bait is spoken of as the “white
food,” an expression used also of the viands prepared at the feast of
the green corn dance, to indicate their wholesome character. “Let
the paths from every direction recognize each other,” means let the
fishes, which are supposed to have regular trails through the water,
assemble together at the place where the speaker takes his station,
as friends recognizing each other at a distance approach to greet
each other, <sup>u</sup>Wâhisâ´nahĭ tigiwatsi´la, rendered “our spittle shall be
in agreement,” is a peculiar archaic expression that can not be literally
translated. It implies that there shall be such close sympathy
between the fisher and the fish that their spittle shall be as the spittle
of one individual. As before stated, the spittle is believed to exert an
important influence upon the whole physical and mental being. The
expression “your spittle has become agreeable” is explained by
A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ as an assertion or wish that the fish may prove palatable,
while the words rendered “there shall be no loneliness” imply that
there shall be an abundant catch.</p>

<h4>CONCERNING LIVING HUMANITY (LOVE).</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Kû! Listen! In Alahi´yĭ you repose, O Terrible Woman, O you have drawn near
to hearken. There in Elahiyĭ you are at rest, O White Woman. No one is ever
lonely when with you. You are most beautiful. Instantly and at once you have
rendered me a white man. No one is ever lonely when with me. Now you have
made the path white for me. It shall never be dreary. Now you have put me into
it. It shall never become blue. You have brought down to me from above the
white road. There in mid-earth (mid-surface) you have placed me. I shall stand
erect upon the earth. No one is ever lonely when with me. I am very handsome.
You have put me into the white house. I shall be in it as it moves about and no
one with me shall ever be lonely. Verily, I shall never become blue. Instantly
you have caused it to be so with me.</p>

<p>And now there in Elahiyĭ you have rendered the woman blue. Now you have
made the path blue for her. Let her be completely veiled in loneliness. Put her
into the blue road. And now bring her down. Place her standing upon the earth.
Where her feet are now and wherever she may go, let loneliness leave its mark
upon her. Let her be marked out for loneliness where she stands.</p>

<p>Ha! I belong to the (Wolf) ( +&nbsp;+ ) clan, that one alone which was allotted
into for you. No one is ever lonely with me. I am handsome. Let her put her
soul the very center of my soul, never to turn away. Grant that in the midst of
men she shall never think of them. I belong to the one clan alone which was
allotted for you when the seven clans were established.</p>

<p>Where (other) men live it is lonely. They are very loathsome. The common
polecat has made them so like himself that they are fit only for his company. They
have became mere refuse. They are very loathsome. The common opossum has
made them so like himself that they are fit only to be with him. They are very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377">[pg 377]</a></span>
loathsome. Even the crow has made them so like himself that they are fit only
for his company. They are very loathsome. The miserable rain-crow has made
them so like himself that they are fit only to be with him.</p>

<p>The seven clans all alike make one feel very lonely in their company. They are
not even good looking. They go about clothed with mere refuse. They even go
about covered with dung. But I&mdash;I was ordained to be a white man. I stand with
my face toward the Sun Land. No one is ever lonely with me. I am very handsome.
I shall certainly never become blue. I am covered by the everlasting white
house wherever I go. No one is ever lonely with me. Your soul has come into
the very center of my soul, never to turn away. I&mdash;(Gatigwanasti,) (0&nbsp;0)&mdash;I take
your soul. Sgĕ!</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This unique formula is from one of the loose manuscript sheets
of Gatigwanasti, now dead, and belongs to the class known as
Yû<sup>n</sup>wĕ´hĭ or love charms (literally, concerning “living humanity”),
including all those referring in any way to the marital or sexual
relation. No explanation accompanies the formula, which must
therefore be interpreted from analogy. It appears to be recited by
the lover himself&mdash;not by a hired shaman&mdash;perhaps while painting
and adorning himself for the dance. (<i>See next two formulas.</i>)</p>

<p>The formula contains several obscure expressions which require
further investigation. Elahiyĭ or Alahiyĭ, for it is written both
ways in the manuscript, does not occur in any other formula met
with thus far, and could not be explained by any of the shamans to
whom it was submitted. The nominative form may be Elahĭ, perhaps
from <i>ela</i>, “the earth,” and it may be connected with Wa´hĭlĭ,
the formulistic name for the south. The spirit invoked is the White
Woman, white being the color denoting the south.</p>

<p>Uhisa´‘tĭ, rendered here “lonely,” is a very expressive word to
a Cherokee and is of constant recurrence in the love formulas.
It refers to that intangible something characteristic of certain persons
which inevitably chills and depresses the spirits of all who
may be so unfortunate as to come within its influence. Agisa´‘tĭ
nige´sû<sup>n</sup>na, “I never render any one lonely,” is an intensified
equivalent for, “I am the best company in the world,” and to tell a
girl that a rival lover is uhisa´‘tĭ is to hold out to her the sum of all
dreary prospects should she cast in her lot with him.</p>

<p>The speaker, who evidently has an exalted opinion of himself,
invokes the aid of the White Woman, who is most beautiful and is
never uhisa´‘tĭ. She at once responds by making him a white&mdash;that
is, a happy&mdash;man, and placing him in the white road of happiness,
which shall never become blue with grief or despondency. She
then places him standing in the middle of the earth, that he may be
seen and admired by the whole world, especially by the female
portion. She finally puts him into the white house, where happiness
abides forever. The verb implies that the house shelters him like a
cloak and goes about with him wherever he may go.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378">[pg 378]</a></span>

<p>There is something comical in the extreme self-complacency with
which he asserts that he is very handsome and will never become
blue and no one with him is ever lonely. As before stated, white
signifies peace and happiness, while blue is the emblem of sorrow
and disappointment.</p>

<p>Having thus rendered himself attractive to womankind, he turns
his attention to the girl whom he particularly desires to win. He
begins by filling her soul with a sense of desolation and loneliness.
In the beautiful language of the formula, her path becomes
blue and she is veiled in loneliness. He then asserts, and reiterates,
that he is of the one only clan which was allotted for her when
the seven clans were established.</p>

<p>He next pays his respects to his rivals and advances some very
forcible arguments to show that she could never be happy with any
of them. He says that they are all “lonesome” and utterly loathsome&mdash;the
word implies that they are mutually loathsome&mdash;and that
they are the veriest trash and refuse. He compares them to so many
polecats, opossums, and crows, and finally likens them to the rain-crow
(cuckoo; <i>Coccygus</i>), which is regarded with disfavor on account
of its disagreeable note. He grows more bitter in his denunciations
as he proceeds and finally disposes of the matter by saying that
all the seven clans alike are uhisa´‘tĭ and are covered with filth.
Then follows another glowing panegyric of himself, closing with
the beautiful expression, “your soul has come into the very center
of mine, never to turn away,” which reminds one forcibly of the
sentiment in the German love song, “Du liegst mir im Herzen.”
The final expression, “I take your soul,” implies that the formula
has now accomplished its purpose in fixing her thoughts upon himself.</p>

<p>When successful, a ceremony of this kind has the effect of rendering
the victim so “blue” or lovesick that her life is in danger until
another formula is repeated to make her soul “white” or happy
again. Where the name of the individual or clan is mentioned in
these formulas the blank is indicated in the manuscript by crosses
+&nbsp;+ or ciphers 0&nbsp;0 or by the word iyu´stĭ, “like.”</p>

<h4>THIS TELLS ABOUT GOING INTO THE WATER.</h4>

<p class="translation">
Listen! O, now instantly, you have drawn near to hearken, O Agĕ´‘yagu´ga. You
have come to put your red spittle upon my body. My name is (Gatigwanasti.)
The blue had affected me. You have come and clothed me with a red dress. She
is of the (Deer) clan. She has become blue. You have directed her paths straight
to where I have my feet, and I shall feel exultant. Listen!</p>


<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from Gatigwanasti’s book, is also of the Yû<sup>n</sup>wĕ´hĭ
class, and is repeated by the lover when about to bathe in the stream
preparatory to painting himself for the dance. The services of a
shaman are not required, neither is any special ceremony observed.
The technical word used in the heading, ă´tawasti´yĭ, signifies
plunging or going entirely into a liquid. The expression used for the
ordinary “going to water,” where the water is simply dipped up with
the hand, is ămâ´yĭ dita‘ti´yĭ, “taking them to water.”</p>

<p>The prayer is addressed to Agĕ´‘yaguga, a formulistic name for
the moon, which is supposed to exert a great influence in love affairs,
because the dances, which give such opportunities for love making,
always take place at night. The shamans can not explain the meaning
of the term, which plainly contains the word agĕ´‘ya, “woman,”
and may refer to the moon’s supposed influence over women. In
Cherokee mythology the moon is a man. The ordinary name is
nû´<sup>n</sup>dâ, or more fully, nû´<sup>n</sup>dâ sû<sup>n</sup>nâyĕ´hĭ, “the sun living in the
night,” while the sun itself is designated as nû´<sup>n</sup>dâ igĕ´hĭ, “the sun
living in the day.”</p>

<p>By the red spittle of Agĕ´‘yagu´ga and the red dress with which
the lover is clothed are meant the red paint which he puts upon
himself. This in former days was procured from a deep red clay
known as ela-wâ´tĭ, or “reddish brown clay.” The word red as used
in the formula is emblematic of success in attaining his object, besides
being the actual color of the paint. Red, in connection with
dress or ornamentation, has always been a favorite color with Indians
throughout America, and there is some evidence that among
the Cherokees it was regarded also as having a mysterious protective
power. In all these formulas the lover renders the woman blue or
disconsolate and uneasy in mind as a preliminary to fixing her
thoughts upon himself. (<i>See next formula.</i>)</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from Gatigwanasti, immediately follows the one
last given, in the manuscript book, and evidently comes immediately
after it also in practical use. The expressions used have been already
explained. The one using the formula first bathes in the running
stream, reciting at the same time the previous formula “Amâ´yĭ
Ă´tawasti´yĭ.” He then repairs to some convenient spot with his
paint, beads, and other paraphernalia and proceeds to adorn himself
for the dance, which usually begins about an hour after dark, but is
not fairly under way until nearly midnight. The refrain, yû´<sup>n</sup>wĕhĭ,
is probably <i>sung</i> while mixing the paint, and the other portion is
recited while applying the pigment, or vice versa. Although these
formula are still in use, the painting is now obsolete, beyond an
occasional daubing of the face, without any plan or pattern, on the
occasion of a dance or ball play.</p>

</div>


<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula is said by the young husband, who has just married
an especially engaging wife, who is liable to be attracted by other
men. The same formula may also be used by the woman to fix her
husband’s affections. On the first night that they are together the
husband watches until his wife is asleep, when, sitting up by her
side, he recites the first words: Sgĕ! Ha-nâ´gwa hatû´<sup>n</sup>gani´ga nihĭ´,
and then sings the next four words: Tsawatsi´lû tsĭkĭ´ tsĭkû´ ayû´,
“Your spittle, I take it, I eat it,” repeating the words four times.
While singing he moistens his fingers with spittle, which he rubs
upon the breast of the woman. The next night he repeats the operation,
this time singing the words, “I take your body.” The third
night, in the same way, he sings, “I take your flesh,” and the fourth
and last night, he sings “I take your heart,” after which he repeats
the prayer addressed to the Ancient One, by which is probably
meant the Fire (the Ancient White). A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ states that the final
sentences should be masculine, i.e., His soul has faded, etc., and
refer to any would-be seducer. There is no gender distinction in the
third person in Cherokee. He claimed that this ceremony was so
effective that no husband need have any fears for his wife after performing it.</p>

<h4>FOR SEPARATION (OF LOVERS).</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Yû! On high you repose, O Blue Hawk, there at the far distant lake. The blue
tobacco has come to be your recompense. Now you have arisen at once and come
down. You have alighted midway between them where they two are standing.
You have spoiled their souls immediately. They have at once become separated.</p>

<p>I am a white man; I stand at the sunrise. The good sperm shall never allow
any feeling of loneliness. This white woman is of the Paint (iyustĭ) clan; she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382">[pg 382]</a></span>
called (iyustĭ) Wâyĭ´. We shall instantly turn her soul over. We shall turn it over
as we go toward the Sun Land. I am a white man. Here where I stand it (her
soul) has attached itself to (literally, “come against”) mine. Let her eyes in their
sockets be forever watching (for me). There is no loneliness where my body is.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ’s book, is used to separate two lovers
or even a husband and wife, if the jealous rival so desires. In the
latter case the preceding formula, from the same source, would be
used to forestall this spell. No explanation of the ceremony is
given, but the reference to tobacco may indicate that tobacco is
smoked or thrown into the fire during the recitation. The particular
hawk invoked (giya´giya´) is a large species found in the coast
region but seldom met with in the mountains. Blue indicates that
it brings trouble with it, while white in the second paragraph indicates
that the man is happy and attractive in manner.</p>

<p>In the first part of the formula the speaker calls upon the Blue
Hawk to separate the lovers and spoil their souls, <i>i.e.</i>, change their
feeling toward each other. In the second paragraph he endeavors
to attract the attention of the woman by eulogizing himself. The
expression, “we shall turn her soul over,” seems here to refer to
turning her affections, but as generally used, to turn one’s soul is
equivalent to killing him.</p>

<p>Listen! “Ha! Now the souls have met, never to part,” you have said, O Ancient
One above. O Black Spider, you have been brought down from on high. You have
let down your web. She is of the Deer clan; her name is Ayâsta. Her soul you
have wrapped up in (your) web. There where the people of the seven clans are
continually coming in sight and again disappearing (i.e. moving about, coming

<p>Listen! Ha! But now you have covered her over with loneliness. Her eyes have
faded. Her eyes have come to fasten themselves on one alone. Whither can her

<p>Listen! Ha! And now you have hearkened, O Ancient Red. Your grandchildren
have come to the edge of your body. You hold them yet more firmly in your

woman has put her (x&nbsp;x&nbsp;x) soul into our hands. We shall never let it go! Yû!</p>

<p>(Directions.)&mdash;And this also is for just the same purpose (the preceding formula
in the manuscript book is also a love charm). It must be done by stealth at night
when they are asleep. One must put the hand on the middle of the breast and rub
on spittle with the hand, they say. The other formula is equally good.</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula to fix the affections of a young wife is taken from
the manuscript sheets of the late Gatigwanasti. It very much resembles
the other formula for the same purpose, obtained from.
A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ, and the brief directions show that the ceremony is alike in
both. The first four paragraphs are probably sung, as in the other
formula, on four successive nights, and, as explained in the directions
and as stated verbally by A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ, this must be done stealthily
at night while the woman is asleep, the husband rubbing his spittle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384">[pg 384]</a></span>
on her breast with his hand while chanting the song in a low tone,
hardly above a whisper. The prayer to the Ancient One, or Ancient
Red (Fire), in both formulas, and the expression, “I come to the
edge of your body,” indicate that the hands are first warmed over
the fire, in accordance with the general practice when laying on the
hands. The prayer to the Black Spider is a beautiful specimen of
poetic imagery, and hardly requires an explanation. The final paragraph
indicates the successful accomplishment of his purpose.
“Your grandchildren” (tsetsûli´sĭ) is an expression frequently used
in addressing the more important deities.</p>

<div class="translation">

Quickly now we two have prepared your arrows for the soul of the Imprecator.

</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭs’ book, is for the purpose of driving
away a witch from the house of a sick person, and opens up a most
interesting chapter of Cherokee beliefs. The witch is supposed to
go about chiefly under cover of darkness, and hence is called sû<sup>n</sup>nâ´yĭ
edâ´hĭ, “the night goer.” This is the term in common use; but
there are a number of formulistic expressions to designate a witch,
one of which, u´ya igawa´stĭ, occurs in the body of the formula and
may be rendered “the imprecator,” i.e., the sayer of evil things or
curses. As the counteracting of a deadly spell always results in the
death of its author, the formula is stated to be not merely to drive
away the wizard, but to kill him, or, according to the formulistic
expression, “to shorten him (his life) on this side.”</p>

<p>When it becomes known that a man is dangerously sick the witches
from far and near gather invisibly about his house after nightfall
to worry him and even force their way in to his bedside unless prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385">[pg 385]</a></span>
by the presence of a more powerful shaman within the house.
They annoy the sick man and thus hasten his death by stamping
upon the roof and beating upon the sides of the house; and if they
can manage to get inside they raise up the dying sufferer from the
bed and let him fall again or even drag him out upon the floor. The
object of the witch in doing this is to prolong his term of years by
adding to his own life as much as he can take from that of the sick
man. Thus it is that a witch who is successful in these practices
lives to be very old. Without going into extended details, it may
be sufficient to state that the one most dreaded, alike by the friends
of the sick man and by the lesser witches, is the Kâ´lana-ayeli´skĭ or
Raven Mocker, so called because he flies through the air at night in
a shape of fire, uttering sounds like the harsh croak of a raven.</p>

<p>The formula here given is short and simple as compared with some
others. There is evidently a mistake in regard to the Red Man, who
is here placed in the north, instead of in the east, as it should be.
The reference to the arrows will be explained further on. Purple,
mentioned in the second paragraph, has nearly the same symbolic
meaning as blue, viz: Trouble, vexation and defeat; hence the Purple
Man is called upon to frustrate the designs of the witch.</p>

<p>To drive away the witch the shaman first prepares four sharpened
sticks, which he drives down into the ground outside the house at
each of the four corners, leaving the pointed ends projecting upward
and outward. Then, about noontime he gets ready the Tsâlagayû´<sup>n</sup>lĭ
or “Old Tobacco” (<i>Nicotiana rustica</i>), with which he fills
his pipe, repeating this formula during the operation, after which
he wraps the pipe thus filled in a black cloth. This sacred
tobacco is smoked only for this purpose. He then goes out into the
forest, and returns just before dark, about which time the witch may
be expected to put in an appearance. Lighting his pipe, he goes
slowly around the house, puffing the smoke in the direction of every
trail by which the witch might be able to approach, and probably
repeating the same or another formula the while. He then goes
into the house and awaits results. When the witch approaches
under cover of the darkness, whether in his own proper shape or in
the form of some animal, the sharpened stick on that side of the
house shoots up into the air and comes down like an arrow upon his
head, inflicting such a wound as proves fatal within seven days.
This explains the words of the formula, “We have prepared your
arrows for the soul of the Imprecator. He has them lying along the
path”. A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ said nothing about the use of the sharpened sticks
in this connection, mentioning only the tobacco, but the ceremony,
as here described, is the one ordinarily used. When wounded the
witch utters a groan which is heard by those listening inside the
house, even at the distance of half a mile. No one knows certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386">[pg 386]</a></span>
who the witch is until a day or two afterward, when some old man
or woman, perhaps in a remote settlement, is suddenly seized with a
mysterious illness and before seven days elapse is dead.</p>

<h4>I HAVE LOST SOMETHING.</h4>

<p class="translation">
Listen! Ha! Now you have drawn near to hearken, O Brown Rock; you never
lie about anything. Ha! Now I am about to seek for it. I have lost a hog and
now tell me about where I shall find it. For is it not mine? My name is &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, for finding anything lost, is so simple as to need
but little explanation. Brown in this instance has probably no
mythologic significance, but refers to the color of the stone used
in the ceremony. This is a small rounded water-worn pebble, in
substance resembling quartz and of a reddish-brown color. It is
suspended by a string held between the thumb and finger of the
shaman, who is guided in his search by the swinging of the pebble,
which, according to their theory, will swing farther in the direction
of the lost article than in the contrary direction! The shaman, who
is always fasting, repeats the formula, while closely watching
<ins class="correction" title="‘the / the’ at line break in original">the
the</ins> motions of the swinging pebble. He usually begins early in the
morning, making the first trial at the house of the owner of the lost
article. After noting the general direction toward which it seems
to lean he goes a considerable distance in that direction, perhaps half
a mile or more, and makes a second trial. This time the pebble may
swing off at an angle in another direction. He follows up in the
direction indicated for perhaps another half mile, when on a third
trial the stone may veer around toward the starting point, and a
fourth attempt may complete the circuit. Having thus arrived at
the conclusion that the missing article is somewhere within a certain
circumscribed area, he advances to the center of this space and marks
out upon the ground a small circle inclosing a cross with arms pointing
toward the four cardinal points. Holding the stone over the
center of the cross he again repeats the formula and notes the direction
in which the pebble swings. This is the final trial and he now
goes slowly and carefully over the whole surface in that direction,
between the center of the circle and the limit of the circumscribed
area until in theory, at least, the article is found. Should he fail,
he is never at a loss for excuses, but the specialists in this line are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387">[pg 387]</a></span>
generally very shrewd guessers well versed in the doctrine of probabilities.</p>

<p>There are many formulas for this purpose, some of them being
long and elaborate. When there is reason to believe that the missing
article has been stolen, the specialist first determines the clan or
settlement to which the thief belongs and afterward the name of the
individual. Straws, bread balls, and stones of various kinds are
used in the different formulas, the ceremony differing according to
the medium employed. The stones are generally pointed crystals
or antique arrowheads, and are suspended as already described, the
point being supposed to turn finally in the direction of the missing
object. Several of these stones have been obtained on the reservation
and are now deposited in the National Museum. It need excite
no surprise to find the hog mentioned in the formula, as this animal
has been domesticated among the Cherokees for more than a century,
although most of them are strongly prejudiced against it.</p>

<p>Listen! O now you are coming in rut. Ha! I am exceedingly afraid of you.
But yet you are only tracking your wife. Her footprints can be seen there directed
upward toward the heavens. I have pointed them out for you. Let your paths
stretch out along the tree tops (?) on the lofty mountains (and) you shall have them
(the paths) lying down without being disturbed, Let (your path) as you go along
be where the waving branches meet. Listen!</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ’s book, is for driving away, or
“frightening” a storm, which threatens to injure the growing corn.
The first part is a meaningless song, which is sung in a low tone in
the peculiar style of most of the sacred songs. The storm, which is
not directly named, is then addressed and declared to be coming on
in a fearful manner on the track of his wife, like an animal in the
rutting season. The shaman points out her tracks directed toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388">[pg 388]</a></span>
the upper regions and begs the storm spirit to follow her along the
waving tree tops of the lofty mountains, where he shall be undisturbed.</p>

<p>The shaman stands facing the approaching storm with one hand
stretched out toward it. After repeating the song and prayer he
gently blows in the direction toward which he wishes it to go, waving
his hand in the same direction as though pushing away the
storm. A part of the storm is usually sent into the upper regions of
the atmosphere. If standing at the edge of the field, he holds a
blade of corn in one hand while repeating the ceremony.</p>

<p>Hayĭ! Yû! Listen! Now instantly we have lifted up the red war club. Quickly
his soul shall be without motion. There under the earth, where the black war
clubs shall be moving about like ball sticks in the game, there his soul shall be,
never to reappear. We cause it to be so. He shall never go and lift up the war
club. We cause it to be so. There under the earth the black war club (and) the
black fog have come together as one for their covering. It shall never move about
(<i>i.e.</i>, the black fog shall never be lifted from them). We cause it to be so.</p>

<p>Instantly shall their souls be moving about there in the seventh heaven. Their
souls shall never break in two. So shall it be. Quickly we have moved them (their
souls) on high for them, where they shall be going about in peace. You (?) have
shielded yourselves (?) with the red war club. Their souls shall never be knocked
about. Cause it to be so. There on high their souls shall be going about. Let
them shield themselves with the white war whoop. Instantly (grant that) they
shall never become blue. Yû!</p>
</div>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, obtained from A‘wani´ta, may be repeated by the
doctor for as many as eight men at once when about to go to war.
It is recited for four consecutive nights, immediately before setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389">[pg 389]</a></span>
out. There is no tabu enjoined and no beads are used, but the warriors
“go to water” in the regular way, that is, they stand at the
edge of the stream, facing the east and looking down upon the water,
while the shaman, standing behind them, repeats the formula. On
the fourth night the shaman gives to each man a small charmed root
which has the power to confer invulnerability. On the eve of battle
the warrior after bathing in the running stream chews a portion
of this and spits the juice upon his body in order that the bullets of
the enemy may pass him by or slide off from his skin like drops of
water. Almost every man of the three hundred East Cherokees
who served in the rebellion had this or a similar ceremony performed
before setting out&mdash;many of them also consulting the oracular ulû<sup>n</sup>sû´tĭ
stone at the same time&mdash;and it is but fair to state that not
more than two or three of the entire number were wounded in actual battle.</p>

<p>In the formula the shaman identifies himself with the warriors,
asserting that “<i>we</i>” have lifted up the red war club, red being the
color symbolic of success and having no reference to blood, as might
be supposed from the connection. In the first paragraph he invokes
curses upon the enemy, the future tense verb <i>It shall be</i>, etc., having
throughout the force of <i>let it be</i>. He puts the souls of the doomed
enemy in the lower regions, where the black war clubs are constantly
waving about, and envelops them in a black fog, which shall never
be lifted and out of which they shall never reappear. From the expression
in the second paragraph, “their souls shall never be
knocked about,” the reference to the black war clubs moving about
like ball sticks in the game would seem to imply that they are continually
buffeting the doomed souls under the earth. The spirit
land of the Cherokees is in the west, but in these formulas of malediction
or blessing the soul of the doomed man is generally consigned
to the underground region, while that of the victor is raised by
antithesis to the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the enemy, the shaman in the second paragraph
turns his attention to his friends and at once raises their souls
to the seventh heaven, where they shall go about in peace, shielded
by (literally, “covered with”) the red war club of success, and never
to be knocked about by the blows of the enemy. “Breaking the
soul in two” is equivalent to snapping the thread of life, the soul
being regarded as an intangible something having length, like a rod
or a string. This formula, like others written down by the same shaman,
contains several evident inconsistencies both as to grammar
and mythology, due to the fact that A‘wanita is extremely careless
with regard to details and that this particular formula has probably
not been used for the last quarter of a century. The warriors are
also made to shield themselves with the white war whoop, which
should undoubtedly be the red war whoop, consistent with the red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390">[pg 390]</a></span>
war club, white being the color emblematic of peace, which is evidently
an incongruity. The war whoop is believed to have a positive
magic power for the protection of the warrior, as well as for
terrifying the foe.</p>

<p>The mythologic significance of the different colors is well shown
in this formula. Red, symbolic of success, is the color of the war
club with which the warrior is to strike the enemy and also of the
other one with which he is to shield or “cover” himself. There
is no doubt that the war whoop also should be represented as red.
In conjuring with the beads for long life, for recovery from sickness,
or for success in love, the ball play, or any other undertaking, the red
beads represent the party for whose benefit the magic spell is
wrought, and he is figuratively clothed in red and made to stand
upon a red cloth or placed upon a red seat. The red spirits invoked
always live in the east and everything pertaining to them is of the same color.</p>

<p>Black is always typical of death, and in this formula the soul of
the enemy is continually beaten about by black war clubs and enveloped
in a black fog. In conjuring to destroy an enemy the shaman
uses black beads and invokes the black spirits&mdash;which always
live in the west&mdash;bidding them tear out the man’s soul, carry it to
the west, and put it into the black coffin deep in the black mud,
with a black serpent coiled above it.</p>

<p>Blue is emblematic of failure, disappointment, or unsatisfied desire.
“They shall never become blue” means that they shall never fail
in anything they undertake. In love charms the lover figuratively
covers himself with red and prays that his rival shall become entirely
blue and walk in a blue path. The formulistic expression, “He is
entirely blue,” closely approximates in meaning the common English
phrase, “He feels blue.” The blue spirits live in the north.</p>

<p>White&mdash;which occurs in this formula only by an evident error&mdash;denotes
peace and happiness. In ceremonial addresses, as at the
green corn dance and ball play, the people figuratively partake of
white food and after the dance or the game return along the white
trail to their white houses. In love charms the man, in order to
induce the woman to cast her lot with his, boasts “I am a white
man,” implying that all is happiness where he is. White beads have
the same meaning in the bead conjuring and white was the color
of the stone pipe anciently used in ratifying peace treaties. The
white spirits live in the south (Wa´hală).</p>

<p>Two other colors, brown and yellow, are also mentioned in the
formulas. Wâtige´ĭ, “brown,” is the term used to include brown,
bay, dun, and similar colors, especially as applied to animals. It
seldom occurs in the formulas and its mythologic significance is as
yet undetermined. Yellow is of more frequent occurrence and is
typical of trouble and all manner of vexation, the yellow spirits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391">[pg 391]</a></span>
being generally invoked when the shaman wishes to bring down calamities
upon the head of his victim, without actually destroying
him. So far as present knowledge goes, neither brown nor yellow
can be assigned to any particular point of the compass.</p>

<p>Usĭnuli´yu, rendered “instantly,” is the intensive form of usĭnu´lĭ
“quickly,” both of which words recur constantly in the formulas,
in some entering into almost every sentence. This frequently
gives the translation an awkward appearance. Thus the final sentence
above, which means literally “they shall never become blue
instantly,” signifies “Grant that they shall never become blue”, i.e.,
shall never fail in their purpose, <i>and grant our petition instantly</i>.</p>

<h4>TO DESTROY LIFE.</h4>

<p class="translation">
Listen! Now I have come to step over your soul. You are of the (wolf) clan.
Your name is (A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ). Your spittle I have put at rest under the earth. Your
soul I have put at rest under the earth. I have come to cover you over with the
black rock. I have come to cover you over with the black cloth. I have come to
cover you with the black slabs, never to reappear. Toward the black coffin
of the upland in the Darkening Land your paths shall stretch out. So shall it be
for you. The clay of the upland has come (to cover you. (?)) Instantly the black
clay has lodged there where it is at rest at the black houses in the Darkening Land.
With the black coffin and with the black slabs I have come to cover you. Now
your soul has faded away. It has become blue. When darkness comes your spirit
shall grow less and dwindle away, never to reappear. Listen!</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula is from the manuscript book of A‘yû´<sup>n</sup>inĭ, who explained
the whole ceremony. The language needs but little explanation.
A blank is left for the name and clan of the victim, and is
filled in by the shaman. As the purpose of the ceremony is to bring
about the death of the victim, everything spoken of is symbolically
colored black, according to the significance of the colors as already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392">[pg 392]</a></span>
explained. The declaration near the end, “It has become blue,”
indicates that the victim now begins to feel in himself the effects of
the incantation, and that as darkness comes on his spirit will shrink
and gradually become less until it dwindles away to nothingness.</p>

<p>When the shaman wishes to destroy the life of another, either for
his own purposes or for hire, he conceals himself near the trail along
which the victim is likely to pass. When the doomed man appears
the shaman waits until he has gone by and then follows him secretly
until he chances to spit upon the ground. On coming up to the
spot the shaman collects upon the end of a stick a little of the dust
thus moistened with the victim’s spittle. The possession of the
man’s spittle gives him power over the life of the man himself.
Many ailments are said by the doctors to be due to the fact that
some enemy has by this means “changed the spittle” of the patient
and caused it to breed animals or sprout corn in the sick man’s body.
In the love charms also the lover always figuratively “takes the
spittle” of the girl in order to fix her affections upon himself. The
same idea in regard to spittle is found in European folk medicine.</p>

<p>The shaman then puts the clay thus moistened into a tube consisting
of a joint of the Kanesâ´la or wild parsnip, a poisonous plant of
considerable importance in life-conjuring ceremonies. He also puts
into the tube seven earthworms beaten into a paste, and several
splinters from a tree which has been struck by lightning. The idea
in regard to the worms is not quite clear, but it may be that they
are expected to devour the soul of the victim as earthworms are
supposed to feed upon dead bodies, or perhaps it is thought that
from their burrowing habits they may serve to hollow out a grave
for the soul under the earth, the quarter to which the shaman consigns
it. In other similar ceremonies the dirt-dauber wasp or the
stinging ant is buried in the same manner in order that it may kill
the soul, as these are said to kill other more powerful insects by their
poisonous sting or bite. The wood of a tree struck by lightning is
also a potent spell for both good and evil and is used in many formulas
of various kinds.</p>

<p>Having prepared the tube, the shaman goes into the forest to a
tree which has been struck by lightning. At its base he digs a hole,
in the bottom of which he puts a large yellow stone slab. He then
puts in the tube, together with seven yellow pebbles, fills in the
earth, and finally builds a fire over the spot to destroy all traces of
his work. The yellow stones are probably chosen as the next best
substitute for black stones, which are not always easy to find. The
formula mentions “black rock,” black being the emblem of death,
while yellow typifies trouble. The shaman and his employer fast
until after the ceremony.</p>

<p>If the ceremony has been properly carried out, the victim becomes
blue, that is, he feels the effects in himself at once, and, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393">[pg 393]</a></span>
he employs the countercharms of some more powerful shaman, his
soul begins to shrivel up and dwindle, and within seven days he is
dead. When it is found that the spell has no effect upon the intended
victim it is believed that he has discovered the plot and has
taken measures for his own protection, or that, having suspected a
design against him&mdash;as, for instance, after having won a girl’s affections
from a rival or overcoming him in the ball play&mdash;he has already
secured himself from all attempts by counterspells. It then
becomes a serious matter, as, should he succeed in turning the curse
aside from himself, it will return upon the heads of his enemies.</p>

<p>The shaman and his employer then retire to a lonely spot in the
mountains, in the vicinity of a small stream, and begin a new series
of conjurations with the beads. After constructing a temporary shelter
of bark laid over poles, the two go down to the water, the shaman
taking with him two pieces of cloth, a yard or two yards in length, one
white, the other black, together with seven red and seven black
beads. The cloth is the shaman’s pay for his services, and is furnished
by his employer, who sometimes also supplies the beads.
There are many formulas for conjuring with the beads, which are
used on almost all important occasions, and differences also in the
details of the ceremony, but the general practice is the same in all
cases. The shaman selects a bend in the river where his client can
look toward the east while facing up stream. The man then takes up
his position on the bank or wades into the stream a short distance,
where&mdash;in the ceremonial language&mdash;the water is a “hand length”
(<i>awâ´hilû</i>) in depth and stands silently with his eyes fixed upon the
water and his back to the shaman on the bank. The shaman then
lays upon the ground the two pieces of cloth, folded into convenient
size, and places the red beads&mdash;typical of success and his client upon
the white cloth, while the black beads&mdash;emblematic of death
and the intended victim&mdash;are laid upon the black cloth. It is probable
that the first cloth should properly be red instead of white, but
as it is difficult to get red cloth, except in the shape of handkerchiefs,
a substitution has been made, the two colors having a close mythologic
relation. In former days a piece of buckskin and the small
glossy, seeds of the Viper’s Bugloss (<i>Echium vulgare</i>) were used
instead of the cloth and beads. The formulistic name for the bead is
<i>sû´nĭkta</i>, which the priests are unable to analyze, the ordinary word
for beads or coin being <i>adélâ</i>.</p>

<p>The shaman now takes a red bead, representing his client, between
the thumb and index finger of his right hand, and a black bead,
representing the victim, in like manner, in his left hand. Standing
a few feet behind his client he turns toward the east, fixes his eyes
upon the bead between the thumb and finger of his right hand, and
addresses it as the Sû´nĭkta Gigăge´ĭ, the Red Bead, invoking blessings
upon his client and clothing him with the red garments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394">[pg 394]</a></span>
success. The formula is repeated in a low chant or intonation, the
voice rising at intervals, after the manner of a revival speaker.
Then turning to the black bead in his left hand he addresses it in similar
manner, calling down the most withering curses upon the head
of the victim. Finally looking up he addresses the stream, under
the name of Yû´<sup>n</sup>wĭ Gûnahi´ta, the “Long Person,” imploring it to
protect his client and raise him to the seventh heaven, where he will
be secure from all his enemies. The other, then stooping down, dips
up water in his hand seven times and pours it upon his head, rubbing
it upon his shoulders and breast at the same time. In some
cases he dips completely under seven times, being stripped, of course,
even when the water is of almost icy coldness. The shaman, then
stooping down, makes a small hole in the ground with his finger,
drops into it the fatal black bead, and buries it out of sight with a
stamp of his foot. This ends the ceremony, which is called “taking to water.”</p>

<p>While addressing the beads the shaman attentively observes them
as they are held between the thumb and finger of his outstretched
hands. In a short time they begin to move, slowly and but a short
distance at first, then faster and farther, often coming down as far
as the first joint of the finger or even below, with an irregular serpentine
motion from side to side, returning in the same manner.
Should the red bead be more lively in its movements and come down
lower on the finger than the black bead, he confidently predicts for
the client the speedy accomplishment of his desire. On the other
hand, should the black bead surpass the red in activity, the spells of
the shaman employed by the intended victim are too strong, and the
whole ceremony must be gone over again with an additional and
larger quantity of cloth. This must be kept up until the movements
of the red beads give token of success or until they show by their
sluggish motions or their failure to move down along the finger that
the opposing shaman can not be overcome. In the latter case the
discouraged plotter gives up all hope, considering himself as cursed
by every imprecation which he has unsuccessfully invoked upon his
enemy, goes home and&mdash;theoretically&mdash;lies down and dies. As a
matter of fact, however, the shaman is always ready with other formulas
by means of which he can ward off such fatal results, in consideration,
of a sufficient quantity of cloth.</p>

<p>Should the first trial, which takes place at daybreak, prove unsuccessful,
the shaman and his client fast until just before sunset. They
then eat and remain awake until midnight, when the ceremony is
repeated, and if still unsuccessful it may be repeated four times before
daybreak (or the following noon?), both men remaining awake
and fasting throughout the night. If still unsuccessful, they continue
to fast all day until just before sundown. Then they eat again
and again remain awake until midnight, when the previous night’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395">[pg 395]</a></span>
programme is repeated. It has now become a trial of endurance
between the revengeful client and his shaman on the one side and
the intended victim and his shaman on the other, the latter being
supposed to be industriously working countercharms all the while,
as each party must subsist upon one meal per day and abstain entirely
from sleep until the result has been decided one way or the
other. Failure to endure this severe strain, even so much as closing
the eyes in sleep for a few moments or partaking of the least nourishment
excepting just before sunset, neutralizes all the previous
work and places the unfortunate offender at the mercy of his more
watchful enemy. If the shaman be still unsuccessful on the fourth
day, he acknowledges himself defeated and gives up the contest.
Should his spells prove the stronger, his victim will die within seven
days, or, as the Cherokees say, seven nights. These “seven nights,”
however, are frequently interpreted, figuratively, to mean <i>seven
years</i>, a rendering which often serves to relieve the shaman from a
very embarrassing position.</p>

<p>With regard to the oracle of the whole proceeding, the beads do
move; but the explanation is simple, although the Indians account
for it by saying that the beads become alive by the recitation of the
sacred formula. The shaman is laboring under strong, though suppressed,
emotion. He stands with his hands stretched out in a constrained
position, every muscle tense, his breast heaving and voice
trembling from the effort, and the natural result is that before he is
done praying his fingers begin to twitch involuntarily and thus cause
the beads to move. As before stated, their motion is irregular; but
the peculiar delicacy of touch acquired by long practice probably
imparts more directness to their movements than would at first seem possible.</p>

<h4>THIS CONCERNS THE BALL PLAY&mdash;TO TAKE THEM TO WATER WITH IT.</h4>

<div class="translation">
<p>Listen! Ha! Now where the white thread has been let down, quickly we are
about to examine into (the fate of) the admirers of the ball play.</p>

<p>They are of&mdash;such a (iyu´stĭ) descent. They are called&mdash;so and so (iyu´stĭ). They
are shaking the road which shall never be joyful. The miserable Terrapin has
come and fastened himself upon them as they go about. They have lost all strength.
They have become entirely blue.</p>

<p>But now my admirers of the ball play have their roads lying along in this direction.
The Red Bat has come and made himself one of them. There in the first
heaven are the pleasing stakes. There in the second heaven are the pleasing stakes.
The Pewee has come and joined them. The immortal ball stick shall place itself
upon the whoop, never to be defeated.</p>

<p>As for the lovers of the ball play on the other side, the common Turtle has come
and fastened himself upon them as they go about. Under the earth they have lost
all strength.</p>

<p>The pleasing stakes are in the third heaven. The Red Tlăniwă has come and
made himself one of them, that they may never be defeated. The pleasing stakes
are in the fourth heaven. The Blue Fly-catcher has made himself one of them,
that they may never be defeated. The pleasing stakes are in the fifth heaven. The
Blue Martin has made himself one of them, that they may never be defeated.</p>

<p>The other lovers of the ball play, the Blue Mole has come and fastened upon them,
that they may never be joyous. They have lost all strength.</p>

<p>The pleasing stakes are there in the sixth heaven. The Chimney Swift has made
himself one of them, that they may never be defeated. The pleasing stakes are in
the seventh heaven. The Blue Dragon-fly has made himself one of them, that they
may never be defeated.</p>

<p>As for the other admirers of the ball play, the Bear has just come and fastened
him upon them, that they may never be happy. They have lost all strength. He
has let the stakes slip from his grasp and there shall be nothing left for their share.</p>

<p>The examination is ended.</p>

<p>Listen! Now let me know that the twelve are mine, O White Dragon-fly. Tell
me that the share is to be mine&mdash;that the stakes are mine. As for the player there
on the other side, he has been forced to let go his hold upon the stakes.</p>

<p>Now they are become exultant and happy. Yû!</p>

<h3><i>Explanation.</i></h3>

<p>This formula, from the A‘yû<sup>n</sup>inĭ manuscript is one of those used
by the shaman in taking the ball players to water before the game.
The ceremony is performed in connection with red and black beads,
as described in the formula just given for destroying life. The formulistic
name given to the ball players signifies literally, “admirers
of the ball play.” The Tlă´niwă (să´niwă in the Middle dialect) is
the mythic great hawk, as large and powerful as the roc of Arabian
tales. The shaman begins by declaring that it is his purpose to examine
or inquire into the fate of the ball players, and then gives his
attention by turns to his friends and their opponents, fixing his eyes
upon the red bead while praying for his clients, and upon the black
bead while speaking of their rivals. His friends he raises gradually
to the seventh or highest <i>galû´<sup>n</sup>latĭ</i>. This word literally signifies
height, and is the name given to the abode of the gods dwelling
above the earth, and is also used to mean heaven in the Cherokee
bible translation. The opposing players, on the other hand, are put
down under the earth, and are made to resemble animals slow and
clumsy of movement, while on behalf of his friends the shaman invokes
the aid of swift-flying birds, which, according to the Indian
belief, never by any chance fail to secure their prey. The birds invoked
are the He´nilû or wood pewee (<i>Contopus virens</i>), the Tlăniwă
or mythic hawk, the Gulĭ´sgulĭ´ or great crested flycatcher (<i>Myiarchus
crinitus</i>), the Tsûtsû or martin (<i>Progne subis</i>), and the A´nigâsta´ya
or chimney swift (<i>Chætura pelasgia</i>). In the idiom of the
formulas it is said that these “have just come and are sticking to
them” (the players), the same word (<i>danûtsgû´lani’ga</i>) being used to
express the devoted attention of a lover to his mistress. The Watatuga,
a small species of dragon-fly, is also invoked, together with
the bat, which, according to a Cherokee myth, once took sides with
the birds in a great ball contest with the four-footed animals, and
won the victory for the birds by reason of his superior skill in dodging.
This myth explains also why birds, and no quadrupeds, are
invoked by the shaman to the aid of his friends. In accordance
with the regular color symbolism the flycatcher, martin, and dragon-fly,
like the bat and the tlă´niwă, should be red, the color of success,
instead of blue, evidently so written by mistake. The white thread
is frequently mentioned in the formulas, but in this instance the
reference is not clear. The twelve refers to the number of runs
made in the game.</p>

The Cherokee plant names here given are generic names, which are the names
commonly used. In many cases the same name is applied to several species and it
is only when it is necessary to distinguish between them that the Indians use what
might be called specific names. Even then the descriptive term used serves to distinguish
only the particular plants under discussion and the introduction of another
variety bearing the same generic name would necessitate a new classification of
species on a different basis, while hardly any two individuals would classify the
species by the same characteristics.</p>

<i>Ada´wĕhĭ</i> is a word used to designate one supposed to have
supernatural powers,
and is applied alike to human beings and to the spirits invoked in the formulas.
Some of the mythic heroes famous for their magic deeds are spoken of as
<i>ada´wĕhĭ</i>
(plural <i>anida´wĕhĭ</i> or <i>anida´we</i>), but in its application to mortals the
term is used
only of the very greatest shamans. None of those now belonging to the band are
considered worthy of being thus called, although the term was sometimes applied
to one, Usawĭ, who died some years ago. In speaking of himself as an ada´wĕhĭ, as
occurs in some of the formulas, the shaman arrogates to himself the same powers
that belong to the gods. Our nearest equivalent is the word magician, but this falls
far short of the idea conveyed by the Cherokee word. In the bible translation the
word is used as the equivalent of angel or spirit.</p>

This word, like the expression “seven days,” frequently has a figurative meaning. Thus the sun is said to be seven awâ´hilû above the earth.</p>
